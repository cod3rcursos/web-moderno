1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,935
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,028
I'm mind-blowingly good in bed.

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,198
Then he sleeps with Olivia
instead of me.

4
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,831
I'm having a baby too.

5
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,342
Yes, I am. A little boy.

6
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,971
- You lied to me.
- You'll be a better doctor for it.

7
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,981
I'm Ionely, Derek.

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,038
I can't.

9
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,051
When Derek broke up with you,
I was there.

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,350
All I ever am is there for you guys
and the one time I need you...

11
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,482
- Are you OK?
- I failed the medical boards.

12
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,492
Karev, it's over. You screwed up.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,653
If I retake the exam and I don't pass...

14
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,823
You will no longer be a surgical
resident at Seattle Grace.

15
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,407
<i> It's an urban myth that</i>
<i>suicide rates spike at the holidays.</i>

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,745
<i>Turns out, they actually go down.</i>

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,816
<i>Experts think it's because people</i>
<i>are less inclined to off themselves</i>

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,382
<i>when surrounded by family.</i>

19
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,996
Looks like Santa threw up in here.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,001
Just go with it, we're being supportive.

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,300
Oh, hey. What do you think?

22
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,698
Did I go too overboard?

23
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,334
Oh, I know sometimes
I can go a little overboard.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,071
- No, we love it.
- It's great.

25
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,909
Oh, yay. I love Christmas.

26
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,005
- We know.
- Clearly.

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,109
<i>Ironically,</i>
<i>that same family togetherness</i>

28
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,882
<i>is thought to be the reason</i>
<i>that depression rates</i>

29
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,753
<i>actually do spike at the holidays.</i>

30
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,586
<i>Yeah, OK, Izzie doesn't count.</i>

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,933
Oh, I thought you might like
to help me decorate it tonight.

32
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,979
Mark our first Christmas together.

33
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,073
I'm Jewish.

34
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,347
Seriously?

35
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:06,085
- My stepfather, Saul Rubenstein?
- Oh, right.

36
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,161
Right.

37
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,157
Right.

38
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,937
Look at her belly.
She's almost as wide as she is tall.

39
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,771
Are her ankles swollen?
Is that why she's waddling?

40
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,142
- What happens when she leaves?
- She's going on leave?

41
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:30,580
What do you think happens when people
push babies out their vaginas?

42
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,845
- Think we'll get a new resident?
- Nah.

43
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,887
They'll let us wander unattended.

44
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:38,151
- See how much damage we can do.
- Yeah, well, you would know.

45
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:42,627
We should all get together and get
Bailey a Christmas gift for the baby.

46
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,163
Or we could organize
a Secret Santa thing.

47
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:49,292
- Listen, Tiny Tim, you can take your...
- Secret Santa sounds great, Izzie.

48
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,768
OK.

49
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,535
We're being supportive.

50
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,037
Hey.

51
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,080
Hey. You OK? You seem...

52
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,843
Yeah. You know...

53
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,052
- Holidays.
- Oh.

54
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,851
Yeah. I do know.

55
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,729
Tim Epstein, 38,
fell off the roof of his house.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,395
I was stringing Hanumas lights
and a shingle came loose.

57
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,839
- Hanumas?
- Hanumas. Christmukkah. We go all out.

58
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,900
- Awesome.
- He fell twelve feet.

59
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,845
The good news is, my head broke my fall.

60
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,546
There are no visible deformities,

61
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,313
but he's having
some focal left arm weakness.

62
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:44,823
He'll probably be fine.
He's always been a little hard-headed.

63
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,985
- Does your head hurt when you laugh?
- Is that a bad thing?

64
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,622
Do you wanna follow my finger
with your eyes, please?

65
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,693
- I know karate.
- Huh?

66
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,768
Uh...

67
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:02,103
Your husband might need a little quiet,
so, there's a cafeteria...

68
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,870
No, no. Whoa. Let 'em stay.

69
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:08,471
Pain or no, I don't want to
miss out on the holidays with my kids.

70
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:12,507
Who would like to take
Mr. Epstein down for a CT?

71
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,075
Stevens it is.

72
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,989
- You should have a dog.
- No dog.

73
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,115
Come on, get a dog.

74
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:23,526
Nadia Shelton, 41, scheduled
for excision of her gastric ulcer.

75
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,531
Lot of good it's done.
She's been scheduled for three days.

76
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,930
Mom, it's not his fault.

77
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,435
Every day she gets rescheduled
for emergencies.

78
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:34,064
- We are sorry for the inconvenience.
- Inconvenience?

79
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,201
Watch your child spend 3 days in pain,
then talk to me about inconvenience.

80
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,644
We get a lot of trauma cases
at the holidays.

81
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:44,444
- Your daughter's ulcer is non-emergent.
- Is that the news?

82
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,611
Are you saying my wife's not important?
Is that what I hear?

83
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,588
- When are you taking her?
- It's not the remote.

84
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,319
We have reservations
to eat at the Space Needle.

85
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,361
- We've had 'em for months.
- All right!

86
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,760
Prep Mrs. Shelton
for her ulcer excision,

87
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,492
- which will happen this morning.
- Thank you!

88
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:05,902
Ernie, I'm so happy!
We're gonna go to the Needle!

89
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,530
Grey, Karev: cover the pit.

90
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:12,635
You can expect all sorts of holiday
idiocy so that is my gift to you.

91
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,976
- Yang...
- Dr. Bailey.

92
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,812
UNOS called.
They have a donor heart for my patient.

93
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,512
- Heart surgery? I'm free.
- I'm available.

94
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,918
No, you're not. You're covering the pit.

95
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,650
- Yang, it's yours.
- Thank you.

96
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,487
Pit!

97
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,328
Damn. Heart transplant.
Woulda liked to have seen that.

98
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,421
- There's tomorrow.
- Maybe for you.

99
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,728
- Meaning?
- I retake the boards tomorrow.

100
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,794
Pretty sure I'm gonna fail,
which makes today my last day here,

101
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:42,466
and I get to spend it
doing stitches in the pit.

102
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:49,306
- So, when does Hanukkah fall this year?
- Uh... No idea.

103
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,817
If there are other traditions
you want me to be aware...

104
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,444
Oh, no, Burke, seriously,

105
00:05:55,521 --> 00:06:00,254
I haven't observed religious holidays
since I was old enough to know better.

106
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,897
"Run as fast as you can.
You can catch him..."

107
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,458
- Good morning, Justin, Marion.
- Good morning.

108
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,128
Hi, Dr. Burke.

109
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,641
I'm here with good news. Great news.

110
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,734
- You don't mean that...
- UNOS called. We have a heart.

111
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,476
- I'll operate this morning.
- You hear that, baby?

112
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,076
Santa Claus is bringing you
a new heart for Christmas.

113
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,986
Tell the fat-ass
to give it to someone else.

114
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,354
I don't want it.

115
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,865
I'm sorry, Dr. Burke. He's tired today.

116
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,533
I'm tired every day.
I hate Christmas every day.

117
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,169
I'd rather not have
another stupid operation.

118
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:57,046
Justin, I know surgery can be
frightening, but you need this heart.

119
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,176
- You've worn out your last one.
- His last one?

120
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,585
Justin had a heart transplant as a baby,

121
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,021
but his heart hasn't aged
as well as he has.

122
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,718
You understand that, Justin?

123
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,058
Your heart can't keep up with you
anymore. You need a new one.

124
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,360
I don't care. I don't want it.

125
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,424
Can you tell me why not?

126
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,105
<i> Dr. Kim, 1471.</i>

127
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,576
- Anxiety attacks, aneurysms and ulcers.
- Must be December.

128
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,047
- Chief, Adele just called.
- Tell her I'm...

129
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,779
She knows you're not in surgery.
And she said to tell you, quote,

130
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,720
"We are going to our niece's
school pageant this morning."

131
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,757
"You have known about it for months."

132
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,123
"After what you pulled
on Thanksgiving..."

133
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:45,153
Then she started using many words
that I don't feel comfortable repeating.

134
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:50,134
- I have seven surgeons on vacation...
- There was something about "divorce."

135
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,736
You'll have to cover my ulcer excision.

136
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,503
Yes, sir.

137
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,306
The woman is unreasonable.

138
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:02,836
When did watching a six-year-old
dressed up like a wise man...

139
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,008
You couldn't hang up the phone?

140
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,018
Male, 44. Had a gastric bypass.

141
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,987
Three weeks post-op.
Reported pain when we found him.

142
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,492
- Said something about fruitcake.
- He must have torn his abdomen.

143
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:18,292
- You'll have to fight me for this one.
- He's all yours. My parting gift.

144
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,936
OK, for your mom, I got a lambswool
blanket, handmade in Edinburgh.

145
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,906
It's soft, comfortable, says "don't hate
me for hurting your son" with fabric.

146
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,569
- You know my mom loves you.
- No, she used to.

147
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,578
I gotta make up ground with these gifts.

148
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:37,639
- So, what do you think, plain or plaid?
- I don't know. Whatever.

149
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,312
- You love Christmas shopping.
- I'm not in the mood for it right now.

150
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,914
How about French food and
Scottish catalogues tonight around nine?

151
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,482
- Well, I guess that depends...
- Come on.

152
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,027
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yeah?

153
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,428
- I have Tim Epstein's CT scans.
- Ah, good.

154
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,397
- OK, what do you think?
- It's not great.

155
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,801
Oh, no, it's not great at all.

156
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,998
Honey bunny, what do you think of this?

157
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,473
Excuse me,
I need to take her blood pressure.

158
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,671
- What is the guy saying?
- I got three arch-moguls on my ass.

159
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,543
- Josh...
- Language! Josh!

160
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:13,108
- Any questions about the surgery?
- Apart from when you're gonna do it?

161
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,675
- We're doing it now.
- Good.

162
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,745
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

163
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:20,314
- Do you have any questions?
- No.

164
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,794
I've had three bleeding ulcers
in the last five years.

165
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:27,196
Yeah. I hope you read the chart.

166
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,733
- Yes.
- Good.

167
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:39,641
- A gastric perforation just came in.
- Damn.

168
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,909
All right,
take Mrs. Shelton back to her room.

169
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,212
- Seriously?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

170
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,945
We'll get to her this afternoon.

171
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,955
Grey, call the ER, tell them
to send him up, and then scrub in.

172
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:57,188
Alex Karev failed his boards,
and he's retaking them tomorrow.

173
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,757
He can't study for a practical
by himself. If he fails again, he's out.

174
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,802
OK, go.

175
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,359
- O'Malley.
- Yeah?

176
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,032
After you drop her off,
get back here and scrub in.

177
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,041
- All right.
- OK.

178
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,304
- OK, Justin.
- I don't want the heart.

179
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,472
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you need it.

180
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,813
And until you're 18,
your mother calls all the shots.

181
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,342
My mother's a liar. You heard.
She said the heart came from Santa.

182
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:27,950
- She shouldn't decide anything.
- Well, you could make a run for it,

183
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,518
but the heart you have
won't get you very far.

184
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,064
- Are we ready?
- Just about.

185
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,225
How about you, buddy? Are you ready?

186
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,672
If I die in the surgery, can you
give this heart to some other kid?

187
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,006
Not gonna happen, Justin.
Not on my watch.

188
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,574
Here we go.

189
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,249
...and it was only one day of oil.
- And then what happened?

190
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,847
- It lasted eight whole days and nights.
- And it was a miracle.

191
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,324
- I wanted to say that part.
- Sorry to interrupt.

192
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:06,331
- You remember Dr. Shepherd?
- Should we talk more privately?

193
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,733
- Just tell us, is it bad?
- The fall caused a subdural hematoma.

194
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,637
- I don't even know what that means.
- That means, your dad...

195
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:18,006
- His brain is bleeding.
- Great.

196
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,774
There is some risk to the surgery,
but it has to happen

197
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,748
- before the bleeding gets worse.
- What kind of risks?

198
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:30,449
The bleed is in an area of the brain
that controls speech and motor control.

199
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:35,051
- We don't need an operation. OK?
- You know, Jake, I think we do.

200
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:39,461
- But, hey, you know something?
- What?

201
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,865
We have a doctor named "Shepherd."

202
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:46,393
"Shepherd."
Is that a sign from God, or what?

203
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,208
Look at that.

204
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,278
Beautiful fit.

205
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,411
Now we have to figure out
why he's so angry.

206
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,922
If I had that mother, I'd be angry too.

207
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,757
- Actually, I do have that mother.
- His mother is not the problem.

208
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,788
- She loves him. She never leaves.
- She also never listens.

209
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,767
- She doesn't know him.
- Justin's depressed. You heard.

210
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,428
He doesn't want to live.

211
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,405
I just hope he changes his mind
before he's too late.

212
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,237
What do you mean, "too late"?

213
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,073
With all medical realities being equal,

214
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,376
why does one patient live
and another dies?

215
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,511
I believe there's
a mind-body-spirit connection.

216
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:39,422
And if Justin really doesn't want
this heart, his body will reject it.

217
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,988
OK, let me get this straight.

218
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:47,761
You don't just celebrate Christmas,
you actually believe in Santa Claus?

219
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:58,107
Dr. Yang, go and schedule
a psychiatric consult for our patient.

220
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,611
- But we're not done here.
- You are.

221
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:13,890
I don't know.
It hurts here and here and back here.

222
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,587
Did you get hit by a truck
and forget about it?

223
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,459
You're judged on bedside manner.

224
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,091
I wouldn't be surprised
if that's why you failed.

225
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,759
Could you be more patronizing?

226
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:26,601
- I didn't ask for your help.
- Enough with the ego, you big baby.

227
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,333
I gave up a surgery for this.

228
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:33,606
Now, like I said,
it hurts here and here and back here.

229
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,237
Oh, and this morning,

230
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,977
I noticed my poop
was a funny grayish color.

231
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,815
Wow.
That's all you can save of his stomach?

232
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:46,119
If eating is what this man lives for,
we should put him out of his misery.

233
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,456
Paging Dr. Karevian.

234
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,495
What did you just say?

235
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:55,262
Just... it's a joke.
Kevorkian, Karevian.

236
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,234
- Alex Karev.
- I get the joke.

237
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,635
I just don't think it's funny.

238
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,104
You see this, O'Malley?

239
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,939
I make one mistake with this scalpel
and this man's dead.

240
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,002
My husband, he makes mistakes
at his job all the time.

241
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,483
As far as I know he's never killed
anyone, but I have, and you will.

242
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,712
And Alex did.

243
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,382
He made a math mistake
and a man died for it.

244
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,288
Run that past your accountant,

245
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,955
see how he'd feel if every mistake
he made, someone ended up dead.

246
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,391
You don't have to like Alex
or care about him.

247
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,460
But you damn well
have to be on his side.

248
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,398
Hold that.

249
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,177
What a great family.
"Hanumas," "Christmukkah..."

250
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,044
And how cute are those kids?

251
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,777
Really, Dr. Stevens. "Christmukkah"?

252
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,050
I think it's sweet.

253
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,552
Know what time of year
neurosurgeons are busiest?

254
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,187
No. There's a "time of year"?

255
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,026
There's no hard or fast rule,

256
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:04,331
but brain injuries tend to pile up
around holidays. Like our friend here.

257
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,338
Folks fall off their roofs
while they string up lights

258
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,842
or go skating for the first time
in a decade, break their heads open.

259
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,539
And every year, people drive
through blizzards to get to parties

260
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:18,674
where they kiss germ-infected strangers
under poisonous mistletoe.

261
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,447
Then they get so drunk
that they smash their heads

262
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,681
through the windshield
on the way home.

263
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,283
Like I said,
there's no hard or fast rule.

264
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,790
- Does this hurt, Mrs. Grey?
- Yes, doctor.

265
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,958
- How about here? Does it hurt here?
- Yes, it does.

266
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:40,836
If you're Ionely, there are excellent
vibrators. I can give you a catalogue.

267
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:44,307
- He failed his boards. I'm helping him.
- Failed your practical?

268
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,504
- Glad you can keep a secret.
- I kept it. It did you no good.

269
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,706
- He needs our help.
- You're not serious.

270
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,113
If it were you?

271
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,310
- It wouldn't be.
- But what if it were?

272
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,945
- It wouldn't be.
- I have to go.

273
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,579
Be a patient. Do it for me.

274
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,420
When Tiny Tim goes Norman Bates
on us I'm blaming you.

275
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,323
- Diagnosis?
- Gallstones.

276
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,089
Yes.

277
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,632
I'm a 55-year-old man,
I'm nauseous, and I'm throwing up.

278
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,294
I didn't ask for any help.

279
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,171
OK, Evil Spawn, you can nurse
your pride, key word being "nurse",

280
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,233
or you can pass your test
and be a doctor. Up to you.

281
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,014
- Any abdominal pain?
- Yes,

282
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,485
from my giant fat belly
all the way to my back.

283
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,988
Oh, and I'm drunk. Hiccup, hiccup.

284
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,990
I got another one for you.

285
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,654
He tried to gift wrap
a 70-inch TV for his wife?

286
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,597
- Hernia?
- Strangulated. Pretty ugly.

287
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,500
And you just know the wife hates TV.
Grey, is that other project covered?

288
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,629
- I think so.
- Then scrub in.

289
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:51,301
O'Malley, go tell Nadia Shelton
she's off the schedule until tomorrow.

290
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,473
- Tomorrow?
- Another day won't kill me, Jimmy.

291
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,072
- Tomorrow for sure.
- Today was "for sure".

292
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,208
What's he saying?

293
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:03,277
- They can't operate until tomorrow!
- Outrageous!

294
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,789
I cannot believe this!

295
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,691
Could you please turn that down?
Your mother needs to rest.

296
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,285
Who are you, my dad?

297
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,388
- Sir, please tell your son...
- Don't talk to me about my son.

298
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,990
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Sorry.

299
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,901
I just think that your wife should rest.

300
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,168
- I can't go Christmas shopping...
- You messed me up.

301
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:26,302
You people have ruined everything.
I hope you're happy.

302
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,337
Again, very sorry.

303
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,576
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- "Very sorry."

304
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,642
That cuts it here, doc, thanks a lot.

305
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,715
Yeah. OK, the way
you're grabbing me now, it's assault.

306
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:47,164
This... is an exam. Pads.

307
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:51,464
What... What the hell? Does Izzie
know... Does Burke know about this?

308
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:55,337
Unbunch your panties, George.
We're helping Alex study. Do it.

309
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,703
I can't hear you
when his hand is on your boob.

310
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,678
Take your hand off my boob, Alex.

311
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,409
Thank you. Study for what?

312
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,713
- Shut it, Yang.
- Alex failed his boards.

313
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,515
- Seriously?
- I failed one part of one board.

314
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,079
Still, that's pretty embarrassing.

315
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,086
Hey, he's all yours, Georgie.
Do your worst.

316
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,165
You're not giving me a rectal.

317
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,634
Do not ask me to cough.

318
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,728
<i> Dr. Cohen to Radiology.</i>

319
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,667
You paged me?

320
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,509
I didn't see a psych consult
scheduled here.

321
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:37,948
I couldn't get one. I tried to, but
they told me to come back in January.

322
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,218
You disrespected me.
You mocked me in my OR.

323
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,657
- That can't happen.
- I... It won't happen again.

324
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,752
You equated my spirituality
with a belief in Santa Claus.

325
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,662
Burke, science is the one thing,
you know,

326
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,132
it's the one thing we have in common.

327
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,066
I'm an intern, you're not.

328
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,901
I'm a slob and you're not.

329
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,635
I say I want to keep
our relationship private

330
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,338
and you tell the Chief of Surgery
and you ask me to move in with you.

331
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:11,178
- And now, you're religious.
- Spiritual. There's a difference.

332
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,740
Well, not to me.

333
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,445
I don't know what we're doing.

334
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,418
Well, right now, we're working.

335
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,158
Page me if he spikes a fever.

336
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,098
Tell Mrs. Davison to hire a therapist,
or a priest.

337
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,295
Anyone Justin will talk to.

338
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,842
- Mrs. Epstein?
- Oh.

339
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,216
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

340
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,881
- He's still groggy.
- My dad wants to see me now, OK?

341
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,821
- OK. Come on.
- OK.

342
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:56,156
- Run-run-run.
- Yeah, let's run-run-run.

343
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,957
Let's run and see Dad.

344
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,555
It's OK, guys, Daddy's OK.

345
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,964
Daddy. Daddy.
I could kiss it better, Daddy.

346
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,632
Jillian, I have a headache.

347
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,504
- I'll sing, Daddy.
- No.

348
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:14,137
- ~ <i>Dashing through the snow...</i>
- No, Leah.

349
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,181
Damn it, Leah, shut up!

350
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,012
I can't stand that insipid song!

351
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,712
- Tim.
- Just get out! Get out!

352
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,688
Get the hell out of here, all of you!

353
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:30,018
You stupid shepherd!
You broke my dad's brain!

354
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,863
How did that happen? His personality...
You didn't go near the frontal lobe.

355
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,432
Well,
the CT might have missed something.

356
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,446
It could be a reaction from anesthesia
wearing off, could be the pain.

357
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,175
He was in pain before surgery.

358
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,242
Watch him for two hours.
If he doesn't improve, get a new CT.

359
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,752
OK.

360
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,982
Dr. Stevens?

361
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,685
You had his brain open, literally open,

362
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,524
he was laying there
unconscious and vulnerable...

363
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,030
I poisoned him
with my anti-holiday venom?

364
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,829
You say there's a lot
about the brain we don't know.

365
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:13,029
How do you know your words
didn't speak to him unconsciously?

366
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,268
I mean, he trusted you to be his...
shepherd.

367
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,445
Dr. Stevens,
you should be a little embarrassed.

368
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,004
- I am.
- Good.

369
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:35,122
Oh, this is the CCU,
there are no trees allowed in the CCU.

370
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,821
I know, but it's never
really been enforced, so...

371
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,454
How's he doing?

372
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:43,558
Surgery went smoothly,
but it's too soon to tell.

373
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:49,231
He's really a good boy. You just met
him at a difficult time. He's been down.

374
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,904
I don't know why. But Father Michael
will be able to talk to him.

375
00:21:55,681 --> 00:22:00,175
No offense, but your son doesn't
seem to be a fan of the holidays.

376
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,119
He doesn't believe in Santa.

377
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:08,182
Yes, well, a mother's job
is to protect her child's innocence.

378
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,463
And this Christmas
could be his last time, so...

379
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:17,332
That's what you said last year,
and the year before that.

380
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,929
Oh, my baby, you're awake.

381
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,974
You look great.

382
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,100
My big strong boy.

383
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,112
Santa brought you back to me.

384
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,142
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, CCU regulations.

385
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:42,492
- Are we using mesh?
- Yes, the conjoined tendon is...

386
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,698
Dr. Bailey?

387
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,531
Just wouldn't want to throw up
in the body cavity.

388
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,094
- Dr. Bailey, are you all right?
- Oh, no.

389
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:58,006
- Do you need...
- Just... I need a minute, Grey.

390
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:02,536
When you operate,
the rest of the world goes away.

391
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:07,881
Hunger, thirst, pain:
you don't feel it in the OR.

392
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:13,858
But it's not that way when you're
sharing your body with another person.

393
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,190
OK. All right.

394
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,025
Do you have a retractor?

395
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,157
Sure you don't want me
to find someone to take over?

396
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:27,467
What I want you to find me
is a strawberry milk shake, extra-thick.

397
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,499
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

398
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,874
Nausea.
Comes with the hunger, Grey. Go.

399
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:40,007
My throat, it's like, wicked sore, yo.

400
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,111
Plus, I got all these sick break outs,
right?

401
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,417
Dude, seriously.

402
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,526
All right, all right!
Sit down, sit down.

403
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,829
Open up your mouth,
I'd like to inspect your tonsils.

404
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,233
Aaaa!

405
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,272
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

406
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,243
Fake sick.

407
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:12,308
I failed my practical board exam.
O'Malley's helping me study.

408
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:17,048
- You failed your... You're helping him?
- Just to study. Nothing else.

409
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,714
- Izzie...
- Don't say my name!

410
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,224
And you are unbelievable!

411
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,525
I was doing mono,
the fever and glands thing.

412
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,963
The acne was just the teenager thing.
Izzie, would you wait?

413
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,002
I say I like the guy,
and you can't stop hating him.

414
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,402
Then as soon as he screws me over,
you're his new best friend.

415
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,839
He failed his boards. This is important.

416
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,307
- He cheated on me.
- Busted?

417
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,742
- Yeah, I'm busted.
- His exam is tomorrow.

418
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,279
You're in on this too?

419
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,714
- He cheated on me! God!
- Told you she'd find out.

420
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,582
- Of course you're in on this.
- She let him touch her boobs!

421
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,247
He cheated on me
with George's skanky syph nurse!

422
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,656
- That is just plain rude!
- We know he cheated on you!

423
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,059
That's why we let you turn
the living room into Santa's Village.

424
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,188
- What?
- We're not big on holidays.

425
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:04,429
You know that. We're being supportive
because you're having a hard time.

426
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,994
But right now, Alex,
he's having a harder time.

427
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,303
Why does everybody care
what kind of time Alex is having?

428
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,866
Because he's dirty Uncle Sal.

429
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,276
- Sorry? Huh?
- You lost me.

430
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,714
Dirty Uncle Sal, who embarrasses
everyone at family reunions

431
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,479
and who can't be left alone
with the teenage girls

432
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,386
but you invite him to the picnic anyway.

433
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,848
- What?
- Still lost.

434
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,257
I have a mother
who doesn't recognize me.

435
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,819
As far as family goes,
this hospital, you guys are it.

436
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,162
So, I know you're pissed at Alex,

437
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,565
but maybe you could try
to help him anyway.

438
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,831
Sort of like
in the spirit of this holiday

439
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,305
you keep shoving down
everybody's throats.

440
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,278
- You...
- What?

441
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,076
- "Boob?"
- <i> Dr. Scott to cath lab.</i>

442
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,417
Somebody get in here. Doctor! Now!

443
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,484
Do something.

444
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,492
Deep breaths.

445
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,324
We're taking you to surgery.
Prep her now.

446
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,329
- It's about time.
- Sorry, I got sidetracked.

447
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,600
Nadia Shelton's ulcer perforated.

448
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,767
She's vomiting blood by the pint.

449
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,835
Is the chief back?

450
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,244
- I haven't seen him.
- No.

451
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:27,945
All right, both of you, scrub in.
I'm gonna need all the help I can get.

452
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,651
Well, there it is.
Left side of his frontal lobe.

453
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,628
- Why didn't we see that before?
- Intracerebral bleeds

454
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:42,565
- can have a delayed presentation.
- Right. You wanna get him out of there?

455
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,728
Just prep an OR.
I'm gonna talk to his wife.

456
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,863
Dr. Stevens.

457
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,339
Nice talking to you.

458
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,672
Think she'll ever talk to me again?

459
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:57,079
Am I invisible?
I'm feeling strangely invisible.

460
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,810
- Also inaudible.
- What?

461
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:04,487
Another surgery?
So, I guess dinner-shopping is out?

462
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,457
Yeah.
It's not gonna happen tonight. Sorry.

463
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,323
You're not.
I'm trying to figure out why you're not.

464
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:14,491
- It's Christmas, Derek.
- Yeah, I know.

465
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,694
It's our season. What is going on?
Are you mad? Depressed? What?

466
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,431
No. Mr. Epstein here is depressed.

467
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,530
He's bleeding from his frontal lobe.

468
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,974
Everything's fine, we're fine, Addie.
I'll see you at home. OK?

469
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,207
You need a second surgery, Mr. Epstein.

470
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,216
The frontal lobe is difficult.

471
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,081
We may be able to improve things,

472
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:39,249
but you should be prepared for the
possibility that things could get worse.

473
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,882
That's great.

474
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,722
That's just great.

475
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:47,692
I'm so glad we came to this hospital so
I could be treated by a bunch of quacks

476
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:51,759
who don't know their asses
from the inside of my skull.

477
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,565
Can I talk to you?

478
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:00,276
This isn't my husband.
This is not my husband.

479
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,836
He doesn't speak to me,
or anyone, this way.

480
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,745
I know this is difficult,

481
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:09,150
but the important thing right now
is that we stop the bleeding.

482
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,279
He's the love of my life.

483
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,484
And I know that
you have a lot of other patients

484
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,652
and you do a lot of other surgeries.

485
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,958
But he's the love of my life.

486
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,364
I just... I just need your word
that you will treat this change

487
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:28,134
in my husband's personality as
seriously as you would a fatal cancer.

488
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,300
Because that's the way
this feels to me and to my kids.

489
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,810
We were happy. We were a happy family.

490
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:37,314
It just... If you could just fix it.

491
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,043
Just fix it.

492
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:43,852
Mrs. Epstein, I'm gonna do
everything in my power, all right?

493
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,321
OK?

494
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,192
I didn't want it.

495
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:52,025
I already got one new heart,
I didn't deserve another one.

496
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:56,557
Justin, you don't have to feel
guilty about having a new heart.

497
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,728
God wants you to live.
That's why He sent you the heart.

498
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,102
I'm not stupid.
God didn't send me the heart.

499
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,641
- There's no such thing as God.
- Justin!

500
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:08,975
Marion. Marion, it's all right.

501
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:13,711
The heart I have now, my mom told me
the heart came from Santa.

502
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:17,949
I thought elves made it in their factory
or whatever.

503
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:22,391
- But that's not true, is it?
- No, it isn't.

504
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,520
Yeah.
Because I heard the nurses talking.

505
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,122
Where it really came from
is some other kid.

506
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,394
Some other kid had to die
so I could live.

507
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,299
Justin.

508
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,065
Baby.

509
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,630
And then I outgrew that kid's heart.

510
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,642
So, for the last two years,

511
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,804
my mom has been praying
that another kid would die for me.

512
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,949
That's what you pray for all the time.

513
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,882
Isn't it, Mom?

514
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,757
That's what she prayed for, Father.

515
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:58,159
- How does God feel about that?
- Justin...

516
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,459
Justin...

517
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,433
Justin, baby. Wake up, Justin.

518
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,162
Nurse!

519
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,899
- Oh, please, no, no...
- Move, please.

520
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,305
- Code blue! Just stay back.
- Justin!

521
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,311
Justin, baby, I'm right here.
I love you.

522
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,976
Please, just shut her up.

523
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,781
He's in V-Fib.
Charge the paddles to 100.

524
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,913
- Charge.
- Clear.

525
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,286
Clear.

526
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,911
Can you get him back on the list?
If it's a bad heart...

527
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,784
- It's not a bad heart.
- Can you get him back on the list?

528
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,756
He's waited two years for this heart.

529
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:02,292
He has to fight for it,
decide he wants to live.

530
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,090
Medically speaking,
is there anything we haven't done?

531
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,597
The way you're feeling right now,

532
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,793
it's why I have to believe
in something bigger than me.

533
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,965
Because if I didn't,
that powerlessness would eat me alive.

534
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,446
- Drill, please.
- Any danger with two

535
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,214
- craniotomies in one day?
- No more than with one.

536
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,886
- Is there any music?
- Any requests?

537
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,861
Christmas carols... or Hanukkah.

538
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,524
Is there such a thing as
Hanukkah carols?

539
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,362
The brain is a mysterious thing,
Dr. Stevens.

540
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:49,065
You never know
what may penetrate the psyche.

541
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,110
- Look!
- Kissing ulcers.

542
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,875
One's perfed, the other one's bleeding.

543
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:01,885
Two ulcers.
I'm not surprised, with that family.

544
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,478
I should have thrown them out.
Why didn't I?

545
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,046
That's what I should have done.

546
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:11,687
Stop whining, O'Malley.
You had your chance, you didn't take it.

547
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,163
Right. Sorry.

548
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,565
- Do not kick me.
- Excuse me?

549
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,937
Are you kicking me under the table,
O'Malley?

550
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,165
No!

551
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,073
Then clearly, I wasn't talking to you.

552
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:34,084
You cannot kick me
while I am doing my job.

553
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,323
Thank you.

554
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,232
Wake up.

555
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,071
No wonder you failed. Do you expect
to learn this stuff by osmosis?

556
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,700
What are you doing here?

557
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,611
I'm a farmer, OK? I've been
drooling, puking, and crapping my pants.

558
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,910
You came here to help me study?

559
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,614
Well, I'm not actually
crapping my pants now, am I?

560
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:13,885
Why would you want to help me
after what I did?

561
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,760
Because it's what Jesus
would freaking do!

562
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:49,486
You know,
I don't believe in Santa either, Justin.

563
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,551
Or God.

564
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,621
I believe in medicine.

565
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,894
And it's a medical miracle you're alive.

566
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:05,666
With the heart you had, you should have
died two weeks after you were born.

567
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:09,543
Except some surgeon figured out a way
to give you someone else's heart,

568
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,515
which is so much cooler than Santa.

569
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,789
So, I'm just saying...

570
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,183
I think you should decide to live.

571
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:30,558
Live so you can become a doctor and you
can find a way to do heart transplants

572
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,603
without someone having to die.

573
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:38,535
Or, you know,
live so you can grow up and have kids.

574
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,510
And you know what?
Raise them not to believe in Santa.

575
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,480
Man, that would piss your mom off.

576
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,484
Just decide to live.

577
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:58,390
Because in your case,
dying really isn't the best revenge.

578
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,782
- How is she?
- She gonna be all right?

579
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:23,378
She lost a lot of blood, but we were
able to replace it and repair the tear.

580
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,912
She's going to require
several days' observation,

581
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,789
- but she should have a full recovery.
- Thank God.

582
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:33,763
"Thank God" is right, because we're
certainly not going to thank you.

583
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,595
We should sue you for all you're worth.

584
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:40,194
We sat here and sat here and sat here...

585
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,729
- You wanna help me out?
- Really?

586
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,403
You got your second chance,
just don't screw it up.

587
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,673
...three whole days for her operation.

588
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,511
I should sue you
and this whole damned hospital!

589
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,676
OK, yeah. You could sue us,

590
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,745
or you could consider the possibility
of just shutting the hell up.

591
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,883
- What did you say to me? Did you hear?
- I heard him.

592
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,792
- You can't talk to her like that.
- Where is my daughter?

593
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,887
- I'd like to see her.
- Well, you can't.

594
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,660
I am her doctor, she is my patient
this is a hospital,

595
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,931
the kind of place where people
generally need peace and quiet.

596
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,201
So, no. Right now, you can't see her.

597
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,209
I'm not saying this because
you threatened to sue Dr. Bailey

598
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:23,304
who spent hours saving your daughter's
life, saving your wife's life.

599
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,542
I'm saying this
because she is my patient,

600
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:29,074
and she is in the recovery wing
of this hospital trying to recover.

601
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,314
And visiting hours are over.

602
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,516
So, good night.

603
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,388
And merry Christmas.

604
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,567
Interns. Too emotional.

605
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,065
Apologies.

606
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:59,207
Uh...
Is the nausea constant or intermittent?

607
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,875
Constant.

608
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,888
When...

609
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,687
When did it first start?

610
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,754
After I worked in the fields all day.

611
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,828
Do you have any allergies
you're aware of?

612
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,271
No.

613
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,674
Izzie...

614
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,957
I never wanted to hurt you.

615
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:45,725
You didn't hurt me.
I don't even know you. I'm a farmer.

616
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:51,763
- You're still the patient?
- What does it look like?

617
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,966
It's organophosphates.

618
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,903
Pesticide poisoning.

619
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,316
Crying's a symptom. That's it, right?

620
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,719
Right.

621
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,986
</i>

622
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,738
Hey.

623
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,333
- Hey.
- You OK?

624
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,710
- You look...
- Yeah, yeah.

625
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,182
- You know. Holidays.
- Yeah.

626
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,082
I do know.

627
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,028
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

628
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,533
- Hey.
- Merry Christmas, Joe.

629
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:07,441
Merry Christmas.
Double scotch, single malt.

630
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,741
You're a good man.

631
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,805
Hey, Dr. Shepherd.

632
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,885
Dr. Shepherd.

633
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:24,694
So, how's Mr. Epstein's frontal lobe?

634
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,730
He woke up smiling.

635
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,391
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

636
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,492
What are you drinking?

637
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:36,037
- It's hot buttered rum. It's delicious.
- It's Dickensian.

638
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,598
No. Well, yeah. It is Christmas.

639
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,202
Christmas, Derek. We love Christmas.

640
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,180
At least we used to.

641
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:51,820
Yeah. Christmas makes you want
to be with the people you love.

642
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,588
I'm not saying this to hurt you

643
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,165
or because I want to leave you,
because I don't.

644
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,203
Meredith wasn't a fling.

645
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,830
She wasn't revenge.

646
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,276
I fell in love with her.

647
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:23,112
That doesn't go away
because I decided to stay with you.

648
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:32,726
<i> There's an old proverb that</i>
<i>says you can't choose your family.</i>

649
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,032
<i>You take what the fates hand you.</i>

650
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,452
<i>And like them or not, love them or not,</i>

651
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,387
<i>understand them or not...</i>

652
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,655
Justin took a turn.
His fever's down and his BP's up.

653
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,995
I wonder what got through to him.

654
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,832
I don't know.

655
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,801
<i>... you cope.</i>

656
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,079
Pretty.

657
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,389
Yeah.

658
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:37,655
<i>Then there's the school of thought</i>
<i>that says the family you're born into</i>

659
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,525
<i>is simply a starting point.</i>

660
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,792
What are we doing?

661
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,527
Lights.

662
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:56,846
<i>They feed you and clothe you</i>
<i>and take care of you</i>

663
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,973
<i>until you're ready</i>
<i>to go into the world...</i>

664
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,150
<i>and find your tribe.</i>
