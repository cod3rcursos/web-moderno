1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,900
So how did your test go?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,100
I feel pretty good about it,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,400
but I won't know for a few days.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,600
Well, we're all pulling for you.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,300
We are?

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,100
You cannot kick me while I'm doing my job.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,400
I thought you could give me an answer to my question about you...

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,300
moving in.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,600
I have a dog.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,300
That's not a dog.

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,900
It's a hyena, escaped from the zoo dressed in dog clothing.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,900
I love dogs.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,600
as doctors,

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,500
we are trained to be skeptical

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,300
because our patients lie to us all the time.

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,700
The rule is,

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,600
every patient's a liar until proven honest.

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,500
Why aren't you prepping for rounds

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
- and stealing all the good cases?
- Well,

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,300
why aren't you prepping for rounds

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,600
and stealing all the good cases?

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,800
No reason.

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,300
No reason.

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,200
Lying is bad...

25
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,900
or so we're told,

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,600
constantly, from birth.

27
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,300
Honesty is the best policy.

28
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,300
The truth shall set you free.

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,800
I chopped down the cherry tree.

30
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,800
Whatever.

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,500
I'm waiting for mcdreamy.

32
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm avoiding burke.

33
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,600
Why are you avoiding burke?

34
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,500
he thinks I moved in with him.

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,400
Why are you waiting for--

36
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,100
mcdreamy's doing me a favor.

37
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Burke "thinks"you moved in with him?

38
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,400
Wait, you're calling him "mcdreamy" again?

39
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,400
The fact is,

40
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,700
lying is a necessity.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,100
thank you for doing this,

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,800
with the needles and the blood.

43
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,500
They won't accept her without a full family history.

44
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm happy to get your mom into the clinical trial,

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
even with the needles and blood.

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,000
All done.

47
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,700
How's that feel?

48
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,600
We lie to ourselves because the truth...

49
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,000
the truth freaking hurts.

50
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,100
It feels good.

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,300
Burke "thinks" you moved in with him.

52
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,200
What does that mean?

53
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,200
Okay, it's not important.

54
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,800
You're calling derek "mcdreamy" again.

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,800
It's nothing.

56
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,500
All right,what are you doing?

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
What are you doing?

58
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Stop repeating what I say.

59
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,600
Stop asking me questions.

60
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,300
cujo has to go!

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,600
He peed on my bed.

62
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,100
My bed, meredith.

63
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,100
- He's our dog.
- No, he's not my dog.

64
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,700
You two bought him without even asking me.

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,100
We rescued him from certain death.

66
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,300
Come on, you guys.

67
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,900
I'm putting my foot down.

68
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,600
Either the dog moves out,or I do.

69
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,400
Foot down now.

70
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,900
Me or the dog,

71
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,900
which is it?

72
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,700
You hesitated.

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
She hesitated!

74
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
You hesitated?

75
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,000
I didn't hesitate.

76
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
I was thinking.

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,300
You have to think about it?

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,900
Fine.

79
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
I'm moving out right now.

80
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,300
Later, I'm moving out later because right now,

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,100
I have rounds.

82
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Tell me that is not a dog.

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,900
it's not a dog.

84
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,800
rick freeark, he's 29.

85
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,500
Severed 3 fingers on his left hand.

86
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,400
Controlled the bleeding in the field.

87
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,300
Vitals stable.

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
Gave him 5 of morphine on the way in.

89
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,500
The fingers?

90
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,100
I had some trouble retrieving them,

91
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
so we took off.

92
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,200
Rig behind us found 'em.

93
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,600
They're iced and ready to go.

94
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,500
- Ten minutes out.
- Great.

95
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,700
Continue with I.V. Fluids and start a course of antibiotics.

96
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,700
- Yang, you wait outside for the fingers.
- Yes!

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,100
You can sew 'em back on, right?

98
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,900
'Cause they sewed that guy's penis back on after his wife chopped it off, right?

99
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Penises and fingers are like apples and oranges.

100
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,400
How did it happen?

101
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,900
I was loading my gear onto the truck for a gig,

102
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
and they got caught in the lift gate.

103
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,000
You're a musician?

104
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
I play the freakin' guitar.

105
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,900
You can sew 'em back on, right?

106
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,500
This is not that big of a deal, right?

107
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,200
Oh, dude, I better not be out of the band.

Greys Anatomy
Season 02 Episode 15
---------------------------------

111
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,700
well, the cuts look clean.

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,500
That's good.

113
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
A clean sever makes reattachment easier.

114
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Now I'm not gonna lie to you,

115
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,300
if the surgery is successful,

116
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,200
we're looking at a long recovery with lots of physical therapy.

117
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,000
Do you smoke?

118
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,000
Why?

119
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,600
Cigarette smoke constricts the blood vessels.

120
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,000
I've seen really good grafts fail over a few cigarettes.

121
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,000
So what are you saying,

122
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,500
I-I smoke a cigarette after my operation,

123
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,700
and--and, boom,

124
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,100
my fingers fall off?

125
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,000
No, first they turn black and necrotic,

126
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,100
and then they fall off.

127
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,400
Well... I don't smoke,so...

128
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,700
really?

129
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,300
'Cause judging by the nicotine stains,

130
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
your fingers do.

131
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
anybody out there?

132
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,200
Hello

133
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,600
don't look at me.

134
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,800
She had hip replacement surgery a month ago and was discharged last week.

135
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,500
Then why is she still here?

136
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,800
Because I am not a bouncer and this is not a nightclub.

137
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,200
I am doing what I can with extremely limited staff and resources,

138
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,700
and if you have a problem with that,

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,500
take it up with the chief.

140
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,500
don't know why there's no sun up in the sky stormy weather...

141
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
mrs. Larson's got to go.

142
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,900
If she refuses to leave,

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,500
what can I do?

144
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
She's 78 and nonambulatory.

145
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,200
You have the upper hand here.Use it.

146
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,500
Oh, karev, can I talk to you for a second?

147
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,900
The results of your medical board exams.

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Wh--aren't you gonna open it?

149
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, I'll open it.

150
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,100
I'm weary all the time

151
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
oh, thank you.

152
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,400
Thank you.

153
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Okay, mrs. Larson,I'm dr. O'malley.

154
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,300
Oh, an irishman.

155
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,900
I love the irish.

156
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,800
They have a--

157
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,700
a sparkle.

158
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,700
You can see it in the eye and the swagger.

159
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,600
Come on, dr. O'malley,

160
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,300
show me the swagger.

161
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,200
The eyes are right,

162
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,900
but, uh,

163
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,400
you'll have to work on the swagger.

164
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,700
Mrs. Larson...

165
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,800
call me sophie.

166
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,900
Now be a doll and bring me a remote.

167
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,500
This one's busted.

168
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,500
Sophie...

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,900
I can't bring you a new remote

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,400
because you're no longer a patient at this hospital.

171
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,600
Now according to your chart,

172
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,400
you have a room waiting for you at the sugar maple nursing home.

173
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,900
I'm staying until my daughter's house is ready.

174
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,800
She's converting her den into my bedroom.

175
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,500
She's doing it in a shade of pink.

176
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,100
Now... bring me a remote, irish.

177
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,700
I'm going to sing until you get back.

178
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:58,300
- Can't go on everything I have is gone stormy weather
- coming right up.

179
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,800
yumi miyazaki, uh, 22,

180
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,800
presented this morning with persistent hiccups.

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,500
She was given 50 chlorpromazine,

182
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
which stopped them for awhile,

183
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,300
but then the hiccups returned,

184
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,400
so she needs a surgical consult to rule out esophageal perforation.

185
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,600
When did your hiccups start?

186
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,600
A few days ago.

187
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,800
She doesn't speak english.

188
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,100
Are you her boyfriend?

189
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,000
Her coach.

190
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,300
Oh, she's an athlete.

191
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, yumi's a competitive eater.

192
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,700
Eating is a sport?

193
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,900
Uh, miyazaki.

194
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,000
She's like a rock star in japan.

196
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,400
Again, eating is a sport?

197
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,600
Tell her I saw her on tv.

198
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,900
Tell her I'm an athlete, too.

199
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm a wrestler.

200
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,100
she wonders how a wrestler got smart enough to be a doctor.

201
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,100
Most wrestlers she knows are dumb.

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,300
just tell her

203
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,000
she hasn't been hanging out at the right gyms.

204
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,200
How about instead you tell her that

205
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,900
a persistent hiccup could be an indication of something much more serious.

206
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,900
schedule an esophagram.

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,600
Oh, she is competing this afternoon at the taste of seattle.

208
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,800
Can't you just give her a stronger dose of that drug?

209
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,600
It seemed to work.

210
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
Did the hiccups come back?

211
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,800
- Yes.
- Then it didn't work.

212
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,700
Ohh.

213
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,900
- Dr. Bailey?
- Be quiet.

214
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,900
dr. Bailey,are you okay?

215
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,400
all right, somebody page addison shepherd.

216
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,900
there he is.

217
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,100
Heartbeat's strong.

218
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,700
Since there's no dilation or effacement,

219
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,900
looks like nothing more than braxton hicks.

220
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Except?

221
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,400
I know the mild-concern tone.

222
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
I've used myself from time to time.

223
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,300
Sometimes, false labor is the body's way of telling you to slow down.

224
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm a surgeon.

225
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,700
I understand the realities of your job,

226
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,000
but you need to understand the realities of your pregnancy

227
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,300
and take it easy.

228
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
If there's anything I can do to help--

229
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,100
well, yeah, for starters,

230
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,500
you can help me get up off this table.

231
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,000
Dr. Bailey...

232
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,200
the G.I. Lab has a couple of questions about ms. Miyazaki's esophagram.

233
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,300
All right, let's go.

234
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,700
dr. Stevens.

235
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,800
Keep an eye on her today.

236
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,800
Watch out for any painful contractions,

237
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,000
more than five in an hour,

238
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,300
anything that could indicate preterm labor.

239
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,000
The favor's not for me, stevens.

240
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,100
You know that.

241
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,100
naomi cline, 43,

242
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,100
had her tricuspid valve replaced three years ago with a porcine valve, sir.

243
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,000
Well, naomi,

244
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm surprised to see you back again so soon.

245
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Pig valve usually holds up 10 to 15 years,

246
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,500
but yours seems to be degenerating a little too quickly for my comfort.

247
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
Oh, heart valve,

248
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,300
schmeart valve.

249
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,600
I got married,dr. Burke!

250
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,600
I found him--

251
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,300
my true love, my...

252
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,700
you jump, I jump.

253
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
look...isn't it beautiful?

254
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,200
And look--

255
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,500
look at that beautiful,

256
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,400
beautiful man.

257
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,300
we, uh,

258
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,000
met in the grocery store.

259
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,700
Oh, honey.

260
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,400
Congratulations.

261
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,300
It's good to see you so happy, naomi.

262
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,400
Yeah.

263
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,800
Uh, so naomi's heart valve...

264
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
wh-what does this mean?

265
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,700
Oh, there's an underlying cause for your wife's valve failure that remains undiagnosed.

266
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,000
Theories, grey?

267
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,000
Rheumatic fever,

268
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,700
chronic use of migraine meds...

269
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,700
or I.V. Narcotics could all cause, uh,

270
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,900
valve disease, sir.

271
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,100
Oh, I don't use drugs.

272
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,200
Don't need 'em.

273
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,500
I've got tom.

274
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
He's my drug.

275
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
aren't you, baby?

276
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,500
She's high, dr. Burke.

277
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,800
No, she's in love.

278
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,600
She's happy.

279
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,900
Nobody is that happy.

280
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
She's on drugs.

281
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,200
Run a tox screen,

282
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,400
but naomi doesn't strike me as a liar.

283
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,500
If she says no drugs,

284
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,700
then there's no drugs.

285
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,900
You develop a sixth sense about these things.

286
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,600
Everybody's a liar.

287
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,600
dr. Grey, is that a dog?

288
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,500
No.

289
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,500
Keep this elevated for awhile, okay?

290
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,300
I'm gonna check in on you in a little bit.

291
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,500
Hey, yang.

292
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,600
You were a little harsh in there.

293
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,100
Well, he was lying.

294
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,600
Besides, your harsh is another man's refreshing.

295
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,900
Well, he's in shock.

296
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,800
You know, he lost his fingers and his only remaining habit all in one day.

297
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,900
We need to be compassionate.

298
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,200
Compassionate?

299
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,500
Yes, it's an emotion.

300
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,500
Have you ever heard of it?

301
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,700
Well, have you?

302
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,400
She's barely back on her feet,

303
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,400
and you've got her calling you mcdreamy again.

304
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,400
Now I was just telling the patient the truth,

305
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,900
so you might want to try it sometime.

306
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,200
Remotes...

307
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
- remotes.
- O'malley.

308
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,100
I'm--I'm getting a remote for mrs. Larson.

309
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,200
What happened to the upper hand?

310
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Have you met mrs. Larson, sir?

311
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,600
Why do you think she's been here this long,

312
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,000
in a private room?

313
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,300
She handled you, too?

314
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,700
Well, she sang for the troops, you know?

315
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,700
Can't we just keep her here

316
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,100
until her room at her daughter's house is ready?

317
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,900
No, we can'T.

318
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,700
Not on surgical service,anyway.

319
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh. Okay.

320
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,500
But some other service?

321
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm the chief, o'malley.

322
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,200
I can't condone turfing patients onto other services.

323
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,000
You hear me, o'malley?

324
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm, uh, I'm missing my program, irish.

325
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,200
And I don't see a remote in that hot little hand.

326
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,700
I noticed your urine output has increased slightly since yesterday.

327
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,800
I'm gonna have to take you to gynecology to make sure you don't have a prolapsed uterus.

328
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,600
Honey, my uterus hasn't been an issue for 30 years.

329
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,200
I know, but it might be an issue now.

330
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,100
You know, one that could keep you here in the hospital for tests.

331
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,000
You drive.

332
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
I'll ride shotgun.

333
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,000
You're not moving out,george.

334
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,100
Oh, yes, I am.

335
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,800
I gave an ultimatum.

336
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,300
I threw down the gauntlet.

337
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,900
I drew my line in the sand.

338
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,300
Well, un-give,

339
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,000
un-throw, un-draw.

340
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,300
A man does not give an ultimatum and then back down.

341
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,000
Meredith had a choice,

342
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,400
and she chose the dog.

343
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,600
A girl chose a dog over you?

344
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,700
- Yes.
- No.

345
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,500
- Are we gonna do this or what?
- Yeah, let's--

346
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,100
let's go.

347
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,300
Don't start without me.

348
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,600
We're not gonna start if izzie doesn't focus.

349
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,400
- Izzie, come on.
- What should I put on the flyer?

350
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,000
- I don't--
- destructive, aggressive hell dog available?

351
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,900
- That's not helping.
- Fine.

352
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,900
Uh, playful, protective puppy.

353
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,900
Need loving home.

354
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,900
Good.

355
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:14,900
I know.

356
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,800
- Hey, george.
- Don't talk to me!

357
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,800
You'll only make me mad.

358
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,900
You're gonna mess up my game and I'm in the zone.

359
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,900
Okay.

360
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,800
What are you doing?

361
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,900
- Oh, it's a flyer.
- izzie

362
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,300
- I'm gonna put it up--
- izzie, come on.

363
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,200
Okay.

364
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,600
Keep your panties on.

365
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,200
All right.

366
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,900
No touching!

367
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,900
go!

368
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,200
You're advertising for a home for doc?

369
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,300
I said I would do it?

370
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,600
And you haven't,and you won'T.

371
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,100
And I don't want george to leave.

372
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,400
Well, at least put that he's not housebroken.

373
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,500
what? It's the truth.

374
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,000
- Okay, so you want me to put the truth.
- Fine.

375
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,600
Vicious, hyper devil mutt is available

376
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,900
and will pee on your bed.

377
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,200
He's your dog, too.

378
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,300
We got him together.

379
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,200
We got him together,

380
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,300
but he's not my dog.

381
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,100
He's not your dog, either.

382
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
He doesn't even know us.

383
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,200
We are not home enough for him to know us.

384
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,000
it's a record.

385
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,000
It's a record!

386
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,400
she's cheating.

387
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,600
I beat your asses.

388
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,000
you wanna be me,

389
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,000
but you can't be me

390
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,900
you wanna be me,

391
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,800
but you...

392
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,400
crap, she's gonna blow.

393
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,300
- run!
- Aah!

394
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
"the surgical floor

395
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,400
"has become a dumping ground

396
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,000
"for patients who aren't even surgical.

397
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
"We are overworked and exhausted.

398
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,700
- "This makes for--"
- the nurses again?

399
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,700
Can't you do something about this?

400
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,900
You used to be one of 'em.

401
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,900
Don't you speak nurse?

402
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,100
That's why you don't get any respect from the nurses--

403
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,200
surgical arrogance.

404
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
I'm not arrogant.

405
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,200
You're killing 'em with that workload.

406
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,200
Look at the board.

407
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,300
What?

408
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,100
That's a beautiful board.

409
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,800
It's a crowded board.

410
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,000
We need more nurses.

411
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,200
Mr. Kamaji,this is probably what's causing her hiccups.

412
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,400
A tear in the lining of her esophagus.

413
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,100
Can you fix it?

414
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,400
Yes, surgically,

415
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,200
and the sooner the better.

416
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,800
After the competition today,

417
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,500
her schedule is clear until march.

418
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,500
No, her schedule is clear now.

419
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,100
She can't compete today.

420
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,900
And if she enjoys the taste of solid food,

421
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,300
I recommend giving up the sport for something a little less aggressive,

422
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
say boxing.

423
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,400
I see.

424
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,900
Could you give us some privacy, please?

425
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,400
Karev...

426
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,100
get the translator up here.

427
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
Let's make sure she's gettin' the whole truth.

428
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,000
Put that out.

429
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,800
Sorry.

430
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,500
I've gotta prep you for surgery.

431
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,900
Can you ask your friends to leave?

432
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
I wasn't gonna light 'em.

433
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,900
I was just holding 'em.

434
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,900
Okay.

435
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,400
Seriously, take 'em.

436
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,400
Throw 'em out.

437
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,300
No, you hang on to 'em.

438
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,800
Seriously, I wasn't gonna smoke.

439
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,800
Seriously, I don't care.

440
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,400
Do what you want.

441
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,900
You don't think I'm gonna be able to quit, do you?

442
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,700
No, I don'T.

443
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,300
- I'm lonely all the time
- oh, no.

444
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,700
Oh, yeah.

445
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
Irish.

446
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,900
That nice lady doctor in gynecology said that

447
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
since I had a hysterectomy back in '74,

448
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,400
I don't have a uterus to prolapse.

449
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,800
Damn it.

450
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,400
I've been feeling a bit feverish.

451
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,400
A woman my age with a fever could be an indication of,

452
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,400
oh, any number of awful diseases.

453
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,100
They took your temperature an hour ago.

454
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,700
It was normal.

455
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,400
I am sorry, sophie,

456
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,000
but I am gonna have to call your daughter.

457
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,300
I'm telling you, I'm warm.

458
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,800
That must be one hell of a dog.

459
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,400
Excuse me?

460
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,200
With those eyes...

461
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,900
and those nice,

462
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,300
firm hands...

463
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,600
a girl chooses a dog over you...

464
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,300
it must be one hell of a dog.

465
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,600
Mrs. Cline's tox screen

466
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,800
and titer both came back negative.

467
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,800
I was sure I was right about that.

468
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Gonna have to adjust your worldview, dr. Grey.

469
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,800
There are people out there who don't lie.

470
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,500
Maybe.

471
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Although, frankly,

472
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,700
the drug use would've explained the valve failure.

473
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,900
So how do we proceed?

474
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,900
Let's schedule mrs. Cline for her surgery.

475
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,700
Okay.

476
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,800
Do you want to come over for dinner?

477
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,600
- What?
- Dinner--

478
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,600
our place--

479
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,800
mine and cristina'S.

480
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,700
Why?

481
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,500
You're cristina's best friend.

482
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,200
I want her to feel welcome to have her friends in our home.

483
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, so she moved in with you?

484
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,800
Yes.

485
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Didn't she tell you?

486
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,800
Of course she told me.

487
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,200
Why wouldn't she tell me?

488
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,700
She's in, right?

489
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,300
Which, you know,

490
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,100
I think is great.

491
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,800
Great.

492
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,000
Thank you.

493
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,400
Just came from mr. Freeark's room.

494
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,200
He's convinced he won't be able to quit smoking.

495
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,000
Says you agree.

496
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,900
Well, he asked my opinion.

497
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,800
You want me to apologize?

498
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,500
No, I want you to go in there and tell him that you're wrong,

499
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,700
that you're having a bad day,

500
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,100
that your favorite uncle died of lung cancer

501
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,900
and every time you see a cigarette, you freak out.

502
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,800
Say whatever you need to say,

503
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,300
but get him to believe that this is about you,not him.

504
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,100
Because if he thinks he won't be able to quit, he won'T.

505
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,700
Then we shouldn't even do the surgery.

506
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,400
Fine.

507
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,600
What is your problem?

508
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,400
I'm your boss.

509
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,000
- What is the matter with you?
- Shut up.

510
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,000
You're not my boss right now.

511
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
We're in an elevator.

512
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,900
That's your specialty, right,

513
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
mcdreamy moments in elevators?

514
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,000
Dr. Yang.

515
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,600
For a moment, I'm not dr. Yang

516
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,800
and you're not dr. Shepherd.

517
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,700
You're the guy who screwed up my friend,

518
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,100
the guy who drove her to get a dog

519
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,600
she can't keep a dog she only got

520
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,200
- because her boyfriend lied to her about his wife.
- I never lied to her.

521
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,200
I know a liar when I see one

522
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,000
'cause I'm a liar.

523
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,800
Fine, you want me to lie to the patient?

524
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,500
Fine, I'll lie.

525
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,800
Yumi.

526
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,800
Hey, the translator's here.

527
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,700
Where's the patient--

528
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,300
miyazaki?

529
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
She left with her friend about 20 minutes ago.

530
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
She wasn't discharged.

531
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,100
Sorry, we're short staffed.

532
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,800
I assumed someone else had done the paperwork.

533
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,400
Damn it.

534
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,900
Unh! Come on!

535
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,400
Damn it.

536
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,900
What are you doing out of bed?

537
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,500
I gotta get a candy bar, man.

538
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,600
You're on morphine,

539
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,400
you're about to have surgery and you can't eat.

540
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,300
Mr. Freeark, please.

541
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,700
- My dad's mr. Freeark.
- Careful.

542
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,700
He's got a combover

543
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,800
and an--an annoying wife named kimberly, so--

544
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,500
rick, listen,

545
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,100
earlier, I was out of line.

546
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,900
No, it--

547
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,000
you got me to think.

548
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,100
I don't want to be a guy sittin' in a bar with a stump for a hand,

549
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,900
having a smoke ten years down the line,

550
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,800
bragging about how I used to play better than dave navarro.

551
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,600
Yeah, you don't want to be creepy, bitter guy.

552
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,400
Here's the thing...

553
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
my last cigarette was this morning.

554
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,900
Only I-I didn't know it was my last cigarette.

555
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,300
What the hell do you think you're doing?

556
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,100
He's making me stand at the back of the O.R.

557
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
While he reattaches rick's fingers.

558
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,200
I mean, I can't even touch a retractor.

559
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,800
I hate him.

560
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,600
Truth--

561
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,700
did you move in with burke or not?

562
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,700
I told him I moved in with him,

563
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
and I'm keeping my old apartment.

564
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,800
What?

565
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,100
I sleep at burke's every night,

566
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,000
my clothes are there.

567
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,900
So I still have my apartment.

568
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,400
Big deal.

569
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
You have to tell him.

570
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,700
Actually, I don'T.

571
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,200
So...

572
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,300
I'm supposed to go to dinner at your fake apartment with the guy you fake live with?

573
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,100
Oh, I would never have you over to dinner with burke.

574
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,900
That's weird.

575
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,800
This is my point.

576
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,600
Stop with the lying.

577
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,800
And you're being honest?

578
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,100
The last time you called him mcdreamy,

579
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,700
you were all atwitter with love.

580
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,800
- We're just friends.
- Uh-huh.

581
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,400
We are.

582
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,000
West nile virus,

583
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,100
are you kidding me?

584
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,300
No, look at her.

585
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,300
She's feverish.

586
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,500
She's much weaker than she was this morning.

587
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,900
She could be decompensating.

588
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
she's been here for a month, dr. O'malley.

589
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,800
Have you see any mosquitoes in this hospital lately?

590
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,600
Oh, such a handsome young man.

591
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,700
Those chocolaty eyes.

592
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,200
In order to test you,mrs. Larson,

593
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,900
we have to do a spinal tap.

594
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,000
Will you be doing it?

595
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,600
Yes, ma'am.

596
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,200
Well, then...

597
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,500
- call me sophie.
- You got it.

598
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,900
Nice meeting you, irish.

599
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,800
So, if you'll just sign here,

600
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,600
- we can go ahead and schedule you for surgery.
- Okay.

601
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,100
You know, you are a gorgeous young woman.

602
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,500
Look at you.

603
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,000
You should smile more.

604
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,900
Mr. Cline.

605
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,300
Oh, uh...

606
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,600
do me a favor.

607
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,500
Sure.

608
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,100
Don't tell her you saw me.

609
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,800
I'm not sure that I'm going to go in.

610
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,900
She'S...

611
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,100
she can be exhausting.

612
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,400
Yeah, she'S...

613
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,500
really happy.

614
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,300
Y-you know, I thought it was just,

615
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,500
you know, falling in love,the wedding.

616
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,800
But I was kinda hoping the honeymoon would be over by now, you know?

617
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,000
I mean, it's not normal,right?

618
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,500
nobody's that happy.

619
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Run a tox screen on naomi cline.

620
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Oh whose orders?

621
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,100
Dr. Burke's, of course.

622
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
I'm sorry to bother you.

623
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,700
The paramedics are on their way in with yumi miyazaki.

624
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,100
She collapsed at the taste of seattle and is vomiting blood.

625
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,700
Damn fool.

626
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,100
Probably tore her esophagus in two by now.

627
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,900
All right.

628
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,000
Mm.

629
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,400
Are you okay?

630
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,900
complications of boerhaave's syndrome.Go.

631
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Pleural effusion,

632
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,000
sepsis, shock.

633
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,000
She's cyanotic with shallow breath sounds.

634
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
B.P. 76 over 42.

635
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,900
Tachycardic to the 130s.

636
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
Started her on high-flow 02

637
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,500
and her second bolus of saline.

638
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,000
all right,let's get her to the O.R.

639
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,100
they're ready and waiting.

640
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,900
Her freakin' coach should be the one on this gurney.

641
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,600
Let's keep our eyes on the prize, karev,

642
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,900
saving this woman's life.

643
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,900
I'll meet you guys up there.

644
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,500
Me, too.

645
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,100
Hey, hey.

646
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,400
What are you gonna do, punch him out?

647
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah.

648
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
So you're gonna kick his ass,

649
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,700
get yourself kicked out of the program

650
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,400
before you have to open your board scores just in case you failed.

651
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,400
god, you're such an idiot.

652
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,200
Dr. Karev, how do I begin the esophagomyotomy?

653
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,400
Cut proximal and distal to the tear to expose the mucosal defect.

654
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,100
Correct.

655
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,800
Then we'll move to debridement of the defect--

656
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,800
ohh!

657
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,500
Dr. Bailey,that's preterm labor.

658
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,000
That's not a braxton hicks contraction.

659
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,700
You're in labor.

660
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,600
Why didn't you call me sooner?

661
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,100
All right,let's get out of here.

662
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,800
I was gonna fashion a gastric patch.

663
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,200
I taught you the procedure.

664
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,400
Now leave.

665
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,400
here. Get that clamp.

666
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,300
I got paged, dr. Grey.

667
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,600
Jeffrey wanted to give me the results of the extensive blood work that I ordered.

668
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,600
You forged my signature?

669
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,100
That's really bad, right?

670
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,200
Yeah, that's really bad.

671
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,700
Naomi is not on drugs.

672
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,600
The tests came back negative.

673
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,600
They did?

674
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,400
They did, again.

675
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,500
Next time you forge my signature, let me know.

676
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,700
Save me a trip.

677
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,000
That's it?

678
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,900
You're not gonna yell and say, "damn it, grey,"

679
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,700
and storm out?

680
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,100
I will if you want me to.

681
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,100
No.

682
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,400
Dr. Burke,

683
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,900
here's another one.

684
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,800
Her serotonin level,

685
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,800
it's through the roof.

686
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,500
Dr. Grey, you took a detailed history.

687
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,200
Mm-hmm.

688
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,300
When did mrs. Cline develop asthma?

689
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,600
After the first surgery.

690
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,600
Why?

691
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,200
We found a carcinoid tumor in the lung.

692
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Very rare,

693
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,300
almost impossible to diagnose.

694
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,000
It masks itself as a bunch of seemingly unrelated symptoms--

695
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,600
adult-onset asthma,

696
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,500
valve failure...

697
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
an increased level of serotonin in the blood...

698
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
which creates a false sense of euphoria.

699
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,900
So naomi's not actually this happy?

700
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,500
She just has a tumor?

701
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,500
exactly.

702
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Thank god.

703
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,500
You people with your tumors.

704
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,100
I tell you,I'm infected with love.

705
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,700
I'm sorry.

706
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,000
Your body is lying to your mind.

707
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,400
Oh, let the lie continue.

708
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,400
Right, baby?

709
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,700
Uh...

710
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
how soon can you cure her?

711
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,700
Tomorrow we can take the tumor out.

712
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,900
If all goes well,

713
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,900
naomi goes back to normal.

714
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,700
Great. Thank you, both.

715
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Thank you for not chewing me out for forging your signature.

716
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,800
Thank you.

717
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,700
I know it was probably you who convinced cristina.

718
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,200
She's very strong,

719
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,500
but she listens to you.

720
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,800
If you told her to move in...

721
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,800
anyway... thank you.

722
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,900
No problem.

723
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,100
Now do you have any sensation in your left arm at all?

724
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,500
No.

725
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,400
- Actually, could I watch?
- yeah.

726
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,300
It's okay.

727
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,400
I want to see every blood vessel and nerve

728
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,400
I'm gonna screw up if I ever smoke again.

729
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,600
Not that I'm gonna...

730
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,400
ever again.

731
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,900
I smoked my last cigarette.

732
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,000
Okay.

733
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,300
Let's get started.

734
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,200
The nursing home says she never showed up.

735
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,000
How exactly is that possible?

736
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,300
She wouldn't leave.

737
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,100
My mother is old and infirm.

738
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,600
You couldn't make her leave?

739
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,300
Have you met your mother?

740
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,100
Fine.

741
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,800
Where is she now?

742
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,700
Oh, hi. I'm dr. O'malley.

743
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,200
She's in the infectious disease service.

744
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,500
Infectious disease?

745
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,500
Since when does she have an infectious disease?

746
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,400
She doesn'T.

747
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,800
She just doesn't want to leave.

748
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,200
She's unbelievable.

749
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
Yeah, she is.

750
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,200
So is her room ready?

751
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
'Cause I can go get her right now.

752
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,100
They have had the room ready for weeks.

753
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,000
No, uh, not at, uh,

754
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,800
sugar maple.

755
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,800
I meant at your house.

756
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,500
I'm sorry?

757
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The--the pink room...

758
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,600
at your house.

759
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,700
hi, sophie.

760
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,900
Irish.

761
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,200
What a wonderful surprise.

762
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,900
You won't catch my disease, will you?

763
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,200
No, I think I'll be okay.

764
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,800
sophie, uh, your daughter was just here.

765
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,700
Uh... nursing homes...

766
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,100
are for old people.

767
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,700
I know I'm elderly.

768
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,700
I do know that.

769
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,100
But if I have to go to that place...

770
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,300
I'm afraid...

771
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,000
I'll become old.

772
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,800
I don't think that's possible.

773
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,300
Oh.

774
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,900
You know that I--

775
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,600
I would keep you here if I could?

776
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,800
Oh, no, darling.

777
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,000
You can't waste any more time with me.

778
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,300
You have to go ball's out with the dog.

779
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,400
Excuse me?

780
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,700
So she chose an animal over you.

781
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,300
So what?

782
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh, women are fools.

783
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,600
That's old news.

784
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,200
But life's too short for you to give in, irish.

785
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,500
So fight.

786
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
You fight for what's yours.

787
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,800
Now that, my friend...

788
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,300
is a swagger.

789
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,100
I'll be closing the peritoneal cavity with zero chromic sutures.

790
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,500
Thank you.

791
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,500
Chief?

792
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
Let's get back to it.

793
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,300
Pull back on that retractor.

794
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Give me more suction.

795
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,400
I'll need a sponge on a stick.

796
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,700
What's going on?

797
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,000
I tried,but you wouldn't listen.

798
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,300
It is now 6:07.

799
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,300
The second shift nurses start at 6:00.

800
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
They're not coming in.

801
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,100
Do you have any idea what a sick-out would do to this hospital?

802
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,800
I've already put in the call for temps.

803
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,700
What's this?

804
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,100
Official notification.

805
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,900
We go on strike in ten days.

806
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
You're doing good, yumi.

807
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,200
You're doin' just fine.

808
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,600
we should get the translator back up here.

809
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,000
She doesn't understand what's going on.

810
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,300
We'll be back.

811
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,200
What the hell are you doing here?

812
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
I never would have...

813
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,700
I thought she would be fine.

814
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,100
I'm sorry.

815
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,200
Don't tell me,tell her.

816
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,800
Tell her how her career is over because of you.

817
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,400
Way better than punching him out.

818
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,200
Hey, uh...

819
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,100
can you...

820
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,600
you want me to open it?

821
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,900
Yeah, you know, it'S...

822
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,600
I can't, so...

823
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,500
I-I shouldn'T.I mean, I--

824
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,900
look, you already think I'm idiot.

825
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,300
It won't be any great shock.

826
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Congratulations.

827
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,600
You are not an idiot.

828
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,800
Except when you're...

829
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,600
being an idiot.

830
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,700
Hey, how's he doing?

831
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,900
Uh, jonesing for a cigarette,

832
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,200
but I think he'll make it to the end of the day.

833
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:16,900
Good.

834
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,700
I was being nice to her.

835
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,300
Okay.

836
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,800
I can be nice without being,you know...

837
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,500
mcdreamy. I know.

838
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,000
I really can.

839
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,800
Okay.

840
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,800
Okay, then.

841
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,000
Bed rest at home until the baby comes.

842
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,300
You do know what bed rest is,

843
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,100
don't you, miranda?

844
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah, hell.

845
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,400
Hell with tv and books.

846
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,700
Here, it's from all of us.

847
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,600
I may be 47 months pregnant,

848
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,800
I may be on bed rest,

849
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,400
I may not be able to see my own feet,

850
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,600
but I am dr. Bailey.

851
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,600
I hear everything,

852
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,400
I know everything.

853
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,400
I'm watching each and every one of you.

854
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,400
And I will return.

855
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,100
strike?

856
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,500
Strike.

857
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,700
You are all a bunch of arrogant surgeons.

858
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

859
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,600
That was izzie.

860
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,700
She refuses to take the dog home.

861
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,100
Mm-hmm.

862
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,000
Fine, if you want me to tell burke I didn't move in,

863
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,300
I'll tell him.

864
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,100
No. Don'T.

865
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,300
What?

866
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,500
Don't tell him.

867
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,600
At least, not right now.

868
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,000
Or tonight.

869
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,500
I just mean wait.

870
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,900
It can wait.

871
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,200
I lied about derek.

872
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,700
We're not just friends.

873
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
I mean, I'm not.

874
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,300
He's still mcdreamy.

875
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,100
I know.

876
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,500
You don't get to choose.

877
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,700
I know you've been going through a bad time,

878
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,400
I know you miss shepherd,

879
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,000
and I know that your life has been admittedly pretty unpleasant these days.

880
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,500
You get points for breathing in and out,

881
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,800
you get to be a little selfish,

882
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,300
but you don't get to choose a dog over me.

883
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,700
I'm george.

884
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,500
I sleep down the hall from you.

885
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,400
I buy your tampons.

886
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,500
I have...

887
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,100
held your hand every time you've asked.

888
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,600
I have earned the right to be seen...

889
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,000
to be respected,

890
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,600
to not have you think of me as less than a dog that you got at the pound.

891
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:42,900
So...

892
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,100
I'm not moving out.

893
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,500
Whether you like it or not,I'm staying.

894
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,500
No matter how hard we try to ignore it or deny it...

895
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,400
eventually,

896
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,000
the lies fall away...

897
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,100
I'm glad you moved in.

898
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,800
So am I.

899
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,900
Whether we like or not.

900
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,200
Okay, doc...

901
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,700
let's go.

902
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,700
hey, doc.

903
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,700
Hey, buddy.

904
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,100
Welcome home. Well...

905
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,600
How are you? Yeah.

906
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,100
He's beautiful.

907
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,800
We brought his toys.

908
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,500
Oh, here's his food and his water dish.

909
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,100
Oh, okay. Hi.Here.

910
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,500
Thanks for doing this.

911
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,300
Uh, I know it's a lot to ask.

912
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,400
Oh, it's all right.

913
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,900
It's just a dog.

914
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,200
Right? Come on, doc.

915
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,600
uh...

916
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,900
we'll just wait--

917
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,400
- wait in the car.
- Okay.

918
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,600
So, he, uh... chews everything.

919
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,000
So don't leave anything out.

920
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,000
he hates cats and small,

921
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
little yappy dogs.

922
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,600
- Oh... not housebroken.
- Oh.

923
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,200
I probably should've told you that.

924
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,900
Yeah.

925
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,500
you don't have to do this, you know?

926
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,400
What? I--you know,I got all this land.

927
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,700
It's just goin' to waste.

928
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,400
Derek.

929
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,300
It's just a dog.It doesn't mean anything.

930
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,700
He'll be fine.

931
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,900
Yeah.

932
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,100
Okay.

933
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,900
- Good night.
- Good night.

934
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,400
But here's the truth about the truth--

935
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,700
it hurts.

936
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,900
So we lie.

937
