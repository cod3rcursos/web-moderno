00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,094
<i> Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,966
Derek's married.

3
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,063
You waited two months to tell me

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,042
and I had to find out by her showing up
and telling me herself?

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,944
- You had brain surgery and didn't say?
- You called my wife?

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,982
- You called mine.
- We're not divorced.

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,949
- Practically.
- You had counseling?

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,110
We had adultery.

9
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,983
- It's best to make a clean break.
- Oh, you're ending this.

10
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,386
I'm pregnant.

11
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,924
Have you bothered to tell Burke
about the baby?

12
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,552
The clinic wouldn't let me
confirm my appointment

13
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,392
unless I designated
an emergency contact person.

14
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,364
- You're my person.
- I am?

15
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,732
I heard your mother was leaving Mayo.
She going back with the UN?

16
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,237
She's, uh, taking time off.

17
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:42,138
- What's your name?
- It's me, Mom. Meredith.

18
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,476
Oh.

19
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,085
You are stupid. Oh, God.

20
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,688
You're a stupid evil sadist
and I want to kill you.

21
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,955
Endorphins are good.
Endorphins are mood elevators.

22
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,053
This is supposed
to make us feel better.

23
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,121
Oh, God. Do you feel better?

24
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,994
I'm stupid.

25
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,900
Slutty mistress.

26
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,528
Pregnant whore.

27
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,665
Sleeping with our bosses
was a great idea.

28
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,404
You know what's ruined for me?

29
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:28,047
Ferryboats. I used to love ferryboats.
And Derek's got a thing for ferryboats.

30
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,385
Now every time I see
a freaking ferryboat...

31
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,550
You know what's ruined for me?

32
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,219
Coronary artery bypass grafts.

33
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,254
And aortic aneurysms.
God, I used to love aortic aneurysms.

34
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,626
<i> Surgeons are control freaks.</i>

35
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,865
<i>With a scalpel in your hand...</i>

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,929
Oh, crap!

37
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,998
<i>... you feel unstoppable.</i>

38
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,873
<i>There's no fear, there's no pain.</i>

39
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,847
- Have you cried yet?
- Hello.

40
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,315
<i>You're ten feet tall and bulletproof.</i>

41
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:02,286
Do you think we'd feel better
if we cried? You know, just let it out?

42
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,788
Probably. Yeah.

43
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,952
<i>And then you leave the OR.</i>

44
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,522
- Do you want to cry now?
- No.

45
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,089
OK, let's jog.

46
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,567
<i>And all that perfection,</i>

47
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,627
<i>all that beautiful control,</i>

48
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,497
<i>just falls to crap.</i>

49
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,141
What is she doing?

50
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,680
She's hanging out with Alex.

51
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,648
Why?

52
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:37,854
I don't know.
I think they might be friends.

53
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,585
Do another one.

54
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,787
"Make the lambs stop screaming."

55
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,065
You guys are wrong about him. Once
you get to know him, he's really sweet.

56
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,696
- He's Alex.
- Punk ass.

57
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:57,106
Grey. Izzie said you have tapes
of your mom performing surgery.

58
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,407
I'd kill to see the Ellis Grey
in action.

59
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,245
Maybe you can come over tonight
and we can all watch it together. Right?

60
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,978
Oh, yeah. If this were a hell dimension.

61
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,886
- Run away, pig boy.
- Do you have a thing for Alex?

62
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,355
- No.
- Oh...

63
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,413
I don't.

64
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,393
Are we saving lives
or having a tea party? Walk faster.

65
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,232
<i></i>

66
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,699
Nice hat.

67
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,904
- Shut up.
- What are you doing here?

68
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,777
- Going back to work.
- You're not cleared for surgery.

69
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,510
Leave me alone.
I've been sitting home for a week.

70
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,885
Watching Oprah give away things on TV.
Oprah, Derek.

71
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,514
You clear me now or I'll hurt you.

72
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,392
You should've thought about me clearing
you before you gave Chief to Burke

73
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,555
- and invited Satan to Seattle.
- Satan?

74
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:56,364
- Good morning. Richard, I like the hat.
- Satan speaks.

75
00:03:56,436 --> 00:04:01,772
I prefer to be called Ruler Of All That
Is Evil, but I will answer to Satan.

76
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,207
- Why is she still here?
- I asked her to stay.

77
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,735
We have a pediatric surgery attending
on maternity leave.

78
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:11,750
Actually, I could use you on a consult.
Will you meet me up there, Derek?

79
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,416
- Yeah. Fine.
- See you, Richard.

80
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,422
- Nice lady.
- I'm not clearing you for surgery.

81
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,015
Fine. I can catch up on my paperwork.

82
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,219
<i></i>

83
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:25,321
Mr. Gaston is scheduled for resection
non-small cell carcinoma today.

84
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,992
He did well overnight,
has remained afebrile.

85
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,627
He's had a dose of ceftriaxone
this morning.

86
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,694
His pre-op labs are unremarkable.

87
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,900
His chest X-rays, um,
are unchanged from the previous.

88
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,273
I own a couple of dry-cleaning stores.

89
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,869
Never believed it
about inhaling the chemicals.

90
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,814
We're going do everything we can
for you, Mr. Gaston.

91
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,646
Did Oncology see him yet?

92
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,245
They're waiting for the surgical path.

93
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,485
- Thank you, Dr. Yang.
- You're welcome, Dr. Burke.

94
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,985
I know, I just think you should
still tell him about the baby

95
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,055
because he'd have the responsibility
of having to pay.

96
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,897
No. You know what?
He will never know. It's over.

97
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,962
After this pregnancy, Burke won't be
a blip on my radar, he'll be a smudge.

98
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,474
- Right.
- You know, Meredith.

99
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,807
Leave the sarcasm up to me.
Really, it doesn't suit you.

100
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,613
Kelly Roche, 23 years old,

101
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,744
in for an ETS for treatment
of erythrophobia and hyperpyrexia.

102
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,345
- Erythrophobia?
- Blushing.

103
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,588
You have any questions
about the procedure?

104
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,655
Doctor Sh...

105
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,997
Dr. Shepherd explained everything.
He was very... helpful.

106
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,559
He gave me some literature... Sorry.

107
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:42,006
Don't be. Half the patients who come
through here have the hots for Shepherd.

108
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,307
Dr. Karev.

109
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,971
What? It's true.

110
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,976
- Hey, why do you do that?
- What?

111
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,349
Act like an ass when everyone but me
is around? They already hate you.

112
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,479
So? What?

113
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,150
There's a new surgical case
coming up from the pit.

114
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,386
Likely diverticulitis. Let's go.

<i> Any available IV nurse to the ER.</i>
<i>Any available IV nurse to the ER.</i>

Hands off me! If I report you
to the chief, you'd be out on your ass.

117
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,837
- Where's the chief?
- Patient's name is...

118
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,236
You're all amateurs!

119
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,037
...complaining of cramping pain
and diarrhea.

120
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,477
- Also suffers from...
- Get away from me! Amateurs!

121
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,071
...AIzheimer's.
- Patient's name?

122
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,414
- Um...
- Yang! The patient's name!

123
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,647
What the hell are you doing here?

124
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,521
How many times have I told you
not to bother me when I'm at work?!

125
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,356
- Ellis Grey.
- Meredith's mother.

126
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,419
Amateurs! You're amateurs!

127
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:06,591
Something you don't need
to go through alone.

128
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,026
Something you don't need
to go through alone.

129
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,131
You don't need to go through this alone.

130
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,098
- Stop it!
- Meredith, are you OK?

131
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:19,270
Dr. Karev, stick with the ETS case.
And, Alex, her blushing impulse.

132
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,466
Not a toy for you to play with
or a button to push. Understood?

133
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,342
Meredith. My great-grandmother,
she died with Alzheimer's.

134
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,779
- Why would you say that?
- Well, I'm just trying to help.

135
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,977
Izzie, the Dr. Shepherds
need an intern up in the NICU.

136
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,020
Wait, both of them?

137
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,452
Together?

138
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:40,151
And me, by myself, with the two
married people who hate each other.

139
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,093
Go. Cristina, you're on the thoracotomy.

140
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,960
With Burke?
Can I have the hateful married couple?

141
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,195
OK, I'm sorry. I thought I was
your resident, not your hostess.

142
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,566
I assign, you take. Is that a problem?

143
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,731
Is there some reason
why it's inconvenient for you

144
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,537
to spend the day in the OR
learning from Dr. Burke?

145
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,204
No, I'm very happy
to be working with Dr. Burke.

146
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,270
George, take care of Dr. Grey.

147
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,976
Yes. Thank you.

148
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,543
She needs a friend right now...

149
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,321
Oh, you mean, Ellis, the...

150
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,184
mother.

151
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,360
- Are you able to work today?
- Yes. I'm fine.

152
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,269
I would understand it
if you wanted to be with your...

153
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,903
No. My mother and I
don't have the easiest...

154
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,135
It's just better if I'm working.

155
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:38,013
- OK. You're on scut.
- Excuse me?

156
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,315
While we take care of your mother,
you can catch up on charting,

157
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,218
run samples to the lab, go over...

158
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,655
I told you, I'm fine.

159
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,716
And I appreciate that you're fine.

160
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,921
I have to anticipate a certain level
of distraction from you.

161
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,524
Even in the face
of all that fine-ness. So scut. Now.

162
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,234
- Where's the mother?
- Gone.

163
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,538
Stuck around long enough
to get the kid strung out then took off.

164
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,942
- Nice, huh?
- Addison...

165
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,913
Derek, I know it's a long shot.

166
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,814
You told me that you had a newborn
with an invasive mass.

167
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:16,218
You failed to mention she's premature,
underweight and addicted to narcotics.

168
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,349
There is no way that this baby
will survive spinal surgery.

169
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,258
- You don't know that.
- Even if she does, she's a mess.

170
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,320
Meningitis, seizures.
She'd live a short, painful life.

171
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,593
- You don't know that.
- It's my job to know.

172
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,157
- You're not God.
- Excuse me?

173
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,102
- Sorry, honey, but you're not.
- Did you call me honey?

174
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,163
- Don't call me honey.
- You're not God, Dr. Shepherd.

175
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,905
If a patient has a chance, which I think
she does, you have a responsibility...

176
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,504
- Don't talk about responsibility.
- You took an oath.

177
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,517
- And don't you dare talk about oaths.
- Derek, I messed up.

178
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,212
People mess up.

179
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,652
You slept with my friend
on my favorite sheets.

180
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,917
- You hate the flannel sheets.
- I love them.

181
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,858
- You like the Italian sheets.
- Stop talking about them.

182
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,657
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna go.
I'll go check on the labs.

183
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,997
- Addison, don't do this.
- Derek. She's this fighter.

184
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,130
- Look how far she's come.
- Don't get attached and involved.

185
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,300
Just don't make her life
more painful than it already is.

186
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:14,870
Derek, please. She has nobody.
She needs someone to fight for her.

187
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,110
She's too far gone.
We have to let her go.

188
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,913
Let her go in peace.

189
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,178
Fine, Derek. Walk away.

190
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,955
It's what you do best.

191
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,656
I've enjoyed the opportunity to show
you my capabilities in this arena,

192
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,859
- however brief.
- Stop fishing, Preston.

193
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,396
You did a good job.

194
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,305
But I'm back now and I don't plan
on going anywhere anytime soon.

195
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,105
I am glad that you're back.
I'm just hiding my joy.

196
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,737
Deep down inside.

197
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,044
And, Chief?

198
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,751
The hat.

199
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,616
It's a little pimped out.

200
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,662
- Welcome back, Chief.
- It's good to be back, Dr. Grey.

201
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,860
What can I do for you?

202
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,096
It's my mother, sir.

203
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:30,312
Sorry I didn't say sooner. I know you
were close, but she made me promise.

204
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:36,328
She seems to be reliving the heyday
of her residency a lot these days.

205
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:40,297
And I just thought maybe
if you could stop by and say hello

206
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,028
it would mean a lot to her.

207
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,327
Oh, of course.

208
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,871
- Do you need a day off or...
- Oh, no. I'm fine.

209
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,514
Yeah.

210
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,781
OK.

211
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,655
- If you could...
- It's the middle of my workday, Thatch.

212
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,851
Thatch? No, I'm Dr. O'Malley.

213
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,592
I'm...

214
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,220
OK.

215
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,193
I just need to check your...

216
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,395
I'm not in the mood to play doctor now.
Hands off. I'm busy.

217
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,733
George.

218
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,205
Damn it, Thatch. I mean it. No!

219
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,764
George.

220
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,551
She's allergic to penicillin.

221
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,283
- Oh, yeah, it said it on her chart.
- Oh.

222
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,121
- You just have to be patient.
- OK.

223
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,184
Do you... Um, who's Thatch?

224
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,463
My dad. Thatcher.

225
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,868
What did she...
Is she talking about him?

226
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,598
- Yeah.
- She never talks about him.

227
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,338
- Are you all right?
- No, yeah, yeah, I'm good.

228
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,879
Um... I can't be here.

229
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,215
Of course, I mean, we're good here.
We're great. So... OK.

230
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,652
OK.

231
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,336
Dr. Shepherd?

232
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,970
Meredith.

233
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,810
I heard. Is it true?

234
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,282
Yeah. Secret's out.

235
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,186
- Dr. Shepherd...
- You don't have to call me that.

236
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,951
Dr. Shepherd,
I want in on a surgical case.

237
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,550
I can't just do nothing all day.

238
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,925
And you owe me this.

239
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,995
And I never ask you
for anything like this, so...

240
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,535
I have an ETS this afternoon.

241
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,298
You'll scrub in.

242
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,540
Here, Dr. Yang.

243
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,412
You're late.

244
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,474
I apologize.

245
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,683
Suction.

246
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:23,253
Just starting to dissect
around Mr. Gaston's tumor.

247
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,956
I've almost got visualization.

248
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,306
Hey, Kelly.

249
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,310
Dr. Sh... Dr. Shepherd.

250
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,779
God. Sorry. Damn it.

251
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,839
- Kelly?
- Yep?

252
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,407
- Kelly.
- Mm-hm?

253
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,477
This might be the last time that
that ever happens.

254
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,250
How are her labs?

255
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,258
H&H are stable,
chest X-rays show no acute process.

256
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,692
- Good. You ready to go?
- Are you kidding?

257
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,923
I've been ready since the third grade.

258
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,695
Did you read the literature? You
understand the possible side effects?

259
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,931
Compensatory sweating of the back,
abdomen, thighs and legs.

260
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,734
Possible gustatory sweating.

261
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,934
Horner's syndrome occurs
in under one percent of patients.

262
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,845
Brachial plexus injury, pneumothorax
and hemothorax are highly unlikely,

263
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,543
but possible side effects
of the surgery.

264
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,417
You did your homework.
Take her to pre-op. I'll alert the OR.

265
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,915
Do you know what all those words mean?

266
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,427
Brachial plexus injury
could cause paralysis of the arms.

267
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,430
Pneumothorax is a collapsed lung.

268
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,256
I know.

269
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:40,363
Are you sure you want to risk all
of that? Over a little bit of blushing?

270
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,041
Is that what you think this is?

271
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,769
A little bit of blushing?

272
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,281
Just a schoolgirl embarrassment?

273
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,910
Look, you both saw what happened
when Dr Sh...

274
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,384
when Dr. Shepherd was here.
What did you think?

275
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,754
Well, I thought you liked him.

276
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:04,558
I do, but do you think I want
a roomful of doctors to know about it?

277
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,257
It's not like we're going to...

278
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:10,063
It's not just you guys.
It's not just this once.

279
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,797
It happens...

280
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:17,171
every time I have a feeling for anyone
in my life.

281
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:27,908
I can't get mad, I can't be happy.

282
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,820
I can't feel anything
without the whole world knowing.

283
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,315
I can't have a secret.

284
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:38,193
Can you imagine living that way
your entire life?

285
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,461
Get away from me,
you insipid little man.

286
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,401
- Calm down.
- Get out of my room!

287
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,497
- Get away from my house!
- What can I do?

288
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,008
Calm down.
Please get some haloperidol.

289
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,978
Don't you give me that look. That sad
little soulful, little puppy routine.

290
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,572
I know it by heart, Thatch,
and I'm over it.

291
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,413
I don't want to hear about your day,
or your students,

292
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,784
for your pathetic
little research grants!

293
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,584
My...

294
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,284
My work is what counts.

295
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,294
It's what pays for this house.

296
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,956
It pays for you
and it pays for Meredith.

297
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,795
And for your precious lifestyle.

298
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,768
So why won't you just leave me alone
and let me do it?

299
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,240
Meredith may think she needs you,
but I sure as hell don't.

300
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,300
- Dr. Grey...
- Here it is.

301
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,087
Are you OK?

302
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,122
That's something
I'm supposed to be asking you.

303
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:59,708
O'Malley! I understand
that you're working on Ellis Grey?

304
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,405
Yes, sir. I'm trying my best.

305
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,176
Keep me informed of her progress
and take care of her.

306
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,308
- She's an old friend of mine.
- Really?

307
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:11,084
I actually could use some help.
Could you help me examine her?

308
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,959
I'm just a little busy just now.

309
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,858
You know... Got to run.

310
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,420
Right. OK.
She seems to think I'm her ex-husband

311
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,489
and she won't let me touch her.

312
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,135
It's funny,
you do look a bit like Thatcher.

313
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,200
I look like Meredith's dad?

314
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,372
Um...

315
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,812
Just take good care of her, George.

316
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,612
But like her dad?

317
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,612
I need help.

318
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,816
- Hey.
- Hey.

319
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,121
- Hey, wait.
- What?

320
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,058
You have an eyelash.

321
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,154
Make a wish and blow it away.

322
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:56,224
Hey, Nurse Ratched. There's a dead guy
stinking up room 4125.

323
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,292
Do something before he rots.

324
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,134
See? That is exactly
what I'm talking about.

325
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,904
Why are you so afraid of showing
people that you're a decent human being?

326
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,540
Remember when he wallpapered the place
with pictures of you in your underwear?

327
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,278
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

328
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,584
That was before I knew you.
Thanks, man. Very helpful.

329
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,887
I need you to help me
do an exam on Meredith's mom.

330
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,359
A standard exam?
You did go to med school, right?

331
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,158
She thinks I'm her ex-husband.
She won't let me.

332
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,460
- Dr. Grey?
- Goddamn it, Thatcher. I'm at work.

333
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,937
I have told you I'm too busy
to deal with you now. No more cartoons!!

334
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,169
- She means interruptions.
- No more interruptions, Thatch.

335
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:41,804
You heard the doctor.
Hi, I'm Dr. Karev. Pleased to meet you.

336
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,007
I've always admired your work.

337
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,846
You're familiar
with the laparoscopic Grey method?

338
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,150
I've studied footage
of the operation you pioneered.

339
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,053
You're something else.

340
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:56,288
Good. Well, then.
We're wasting time. Let's scrub in.

341
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,990
Well, I'm going to need to do
a short exam before you start surgery.

342
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:04,126
I know, new hospital policy,
annoying bureaucrats.

343
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,398
Make it quick.

344
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,496
Why don't you wait outside, Thatcher?

345
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,474
I can take it from here.

346
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,568
Take a deep breath.

347
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,219
- She's got a good grip.
- Yeah.

348
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,021
I don't think it...
It doesn't look good.

349
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,156
She's got a resistant strain
of pneumococcus.

350
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,732
The antibiotics aren't working.

351
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:42,240
You may want to get yourself reassigned,
I don't think we'll be operating today.

352
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,707
So, do you think
Dr. Shepherd was right?

353
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,370
She's too far gone.

354
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,572
She does have a good grip.

355
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,281
The tumor has infiltrated
the pericardium.

356
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,887
Sat's down to 95.

357
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,390
Yang?

358
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,869
Yang?

359
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,701
What, sorry?

360
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,241
Is my surgery interfering
with your daydreaming?

361
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,744
No. Sorry.

362
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,738
Forceps.

363
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,310
CVP is 241.

364
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,352
- You have a problem?
- No.

365
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,952
- You have a mocha latte?
- No.

366
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,791
Then go away.

367
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,891
Actually, I need a new assignment.

368
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,937
The Shepherds' preemie case
is non-surgical.

369
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,632
- Non-surgical?
- Non-operable.

370
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,943
- Sucks.
- Yeah.

371
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:57,004
Did you know about Ellis Grey?
Did Meredith tell you?

372
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,516
No.

373
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:03,076
It's just, you think you know someone.
You know who they are.

374
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,455
You share a house
or make wishes on eyelashes with them.

375
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:11,485
And we don't know each other.
None of us.

376
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,294
We're just a bunch of interns who
work together. There's nothing there.

377
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:21,299
There's an arrhythmia
when I press down on the tumor.

378
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,565
That is a sign of what, Yang?

379
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,567
Um...

380
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,405
It's a sign of... It's a...

381
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:34,475
It's a sign that the tumor
has infiltrated the pericardium.

382
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,145
Possibilities?

383
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,054
You know, I'm sorry, I...

384
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,853
Do your homework, Yang.

385
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,895
It could be causing a tear
in the outer muscle of the heart.

386
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,089
So he's got a broken heart?

387
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,892
- Dr. Yang?
- Cristina? Cristina?

388
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,403
<i> Somebody help her!</i>

389
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,916
Cristina? Cristina? Don't just stand
there, damn it. Somebody help her.

390
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,216
- Get a gurney in here! Cristina?
- Cristina!

391
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,119
- We've got it.
- Talk to me.

392
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,886
- What do we know? Talk to me, Stevens!
- I don't know!

393
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,520
- Come on, people, let's move!
- What hurts?

394
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,895
Let's get her out of here.
There's a patient on the table. Lift.

395
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,895
Good, good, good.

396
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,596
Dr. Bailey,
when she's stable I need a report.

397
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,729
- Dr. Bailey?
- Right, Dr. Burke.

398
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:35,076
Her pulse is racing.
I need her on a monitor to get a BP.

399
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,583
Also, I want her started
on a liter of LR wide open.

400
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,880
Izzie,
let Emergency know we're on our way.

401
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,080
Seven weeks. I'm pregnant, Izzie.
Izzie, I'm pregnant.

402
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,453
Uh, OK. No, we're going to pre-op
instead. Find Addison Shepherd.

403
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,258
And, Izzie, be discreet.

404
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,490
So I'm leaving in the morning.

405
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,297
- No.
- Excuse me?

406
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,531
No, I'm not accepting your resignation.

407
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,937
It's not a resignation,
it's notification.

408
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,703
I don't officially work for you.

409
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,769
I came here for one case. I can track
the twins' progress from New York.

410
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,214
- What about the preemie?
- I'm letting it go. You know that.

411
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,879
He calls me Satan, Richard.

412
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,890
- You don't like to hide from a fight.
- No fight. He wins.

413
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,983
I'm leaving in the morning.

414
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,188
- What is it, O'Malley?
- It's Dr. Grey, sir. Ellis.

415
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:33,627
CT confirmed diverticulitis,
but a liver mass was also found.

416
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:34,933
My God.

417
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,702
Poor Meredith.
As if Alzheimer's wasn't bad enough.

418
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,505
Now her mother has liver cancer.

419
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,547
You won't know that it's cancer
until you do a biopsy.

420
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,013
Right. Sorry.

421
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:47,313
Excuse me, Dr. Shepherd,
we need you. Fast.

422
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:53,415
Um, It's Cristina. One of our interns,
she's... she's collapsed.

423
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,517
Cristina's collapsed?

424
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,255
Why do you need me?

425
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:07,127
- Cristina's pregnant?
- Shut up, George! Please come.

426
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:11,266
This doesn't change anything, Richard.
I'm still leaving in the morning.

427
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,503
This is a very bad day.

428
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,309
OK, Dr. Karev,
if we're going to stop her blushing,

429
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:22,081
we have to expose the sympathetic
ganglion chain, which resides where?

430
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:25,179
- It's time to clear me for surgery.
- What?

431
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,715
- I know you heard me.
- I'm a little busy. We'll talk later.

432
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,317
Just give a verbal OK

433
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,091
- and we can do the paperwork later.
- I cannot do that.

434
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,359
I'm chief of surgery.
This is not a request.

435
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:39,028
With respect, in this case, I'm not
your subordinate, I'm your doctor.

436
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,335
One week after brain surgery,
you are not ready for surgery.

437
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,706
It's a simple procedure.
A needle biopsy. A resident could do it.

438
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:49,213
So let a resident do it.
What am I missing here?

439
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,743
It's for my mother, isn't it?

440
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,150
You think she has cancer?

441
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,619
George needs your signature.

442
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,893
Look, Richard, I know she's your friend.

443
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,197
But I'm not clearing you for surgery.

444
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,362
What's her total bili?

445
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:18,000
It's actually only four.
It's not great, but it's not terrible.

446
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,510
That's why I didn't see the jaundice.

447
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,571
No one could.
We just have to wait and see.

448
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,116
What aren't you telling me?

449
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,179
It's Cristina.

450
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,248
Have you notified the father?

451
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,294
Cristina? Cristina?

452
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,955
Cristina? Cristina?
Is there anyone we can call?

453
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,795
- We're losing her.
- Can you see that?

454
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,600
It was an extrauterine pregnancy.
The tube burst. She's bleeding out.

455
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:03,578
Good, you're finished.
Look, I need you to do a needle biopsy.

456
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:07,182
I've got to go check on...
There's someone I need to see about.

457
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:10,557
An intern collapsed in the middle
of surgery, so if it can wait...

458
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,120
No, I need you to do
a needle biopsy now.

459
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,257
Chief, now is not the time.

460
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,598
I am not in the mood for a debate.
You understand?

461
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,935
You'll do it because I asked you to.

462
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,001
Because I need you to.

463
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,812
It's Ellis Grey.

464
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,749
<i> Dr. Cohen to Pediatrics.</i>
<i>Dr. Cohen to Pediatrics.</i>

465
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,934
She's going to be OK. Right?

466
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,096
How attached was she to this pregnancy?

467
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,539
I don't know.
She's a pretty private person.

468
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,911
She's lost a lot of blood,
but I've got it from here.

469
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,383
Dr. Bailey? You must have
a surgery or two of your own today?

470
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,477
I'm fine right here.

471
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,326
Can you do the follow-up?
I'll check on Cristina.

472
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,894
Yeah. You know what's wrong with her?

473
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,462
- Don't.
- Sorry.

474
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:33,705
Don't be sorry. I'm so tired
of you being sorry. Don't do it.

475
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,508
- Dr. Grey...
- Dr. Grey? Seriously?

476
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,243
Are you concerned
about Alex finding out about us?

477
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,809
Is that what matters to you?
Do you really think he cares?

478
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,220
Alex, do you care that
I was the intern stupid enough

479
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,725
- to screw the married attending?
- No.

480
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,161
- Meredith, it's OK.
- It's not OK! You have a wife.

481
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,392
Who is not easy to hate.

482
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,698
Who's annoyingly kind
and painfully smart,

483
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,399
- and currently saving my friend's life.
- Meredith. Will you just...

484
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:06,934
Don't! Stop talking to me
like you're my boyfriend.

485
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,002
Stop talking to me at all.

486
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,074
Dude. That was rough.

487
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,958
- You need something?
- I'm coming in.

488
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,160
- No, you're not.
- I am. I'm her friend.

489
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:35,798
Exactly. She's lying on the
operating table. Naked and exposed.

490
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,275
She's sedated, but she's
probably scared out of her mind.

491
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,278
Right now, she's not your friend.

492
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,713
She's a patient who deserves
to have all the privacy I can give her.

493
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,774
You're not going in there.

494
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,553
We went jogging this morning.

495
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,390
I made her go jogging.
There's no way that could have...

496
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,624
No. No. It started out this way.

497
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,858
Nothing caused it to happen.

498
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,069
You have to let me in there.

499
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,232
You can try,
but I'll have take you down.

500
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:15,409
Hey, I may be short
but you're pretty tiny. I could do it.

501
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,610
Right now, just in this moment,
I hate you.

502
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,477
Yeah, well, I can take it.

503
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,691
Dr. Grey, we're going
to put you to sleep for a little while,

504
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:34,323
but I promise we'll have you
back into surgery in no time.

505
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,165
Richard. Thank God you're here.

506
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,296
You beautiful man.

507
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,866
That husband of mine
has been making me crazy.

508
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,885
Look at that. BP's stabilizing.

509
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,421
Well, she's stronger since this morning.

510
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:35,926
There's no reason in the world why she
should be stronger since this morning.

511
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:41,621
She's really beautiful, isn't she?

512
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,634
Tell you what.
If she makes it through the night

513
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:48,069
and she has a little bit more strength,
we'll operate.

514
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,240
You know, the way I see it,

515
00:31:56,314 --> 00:32:01,843
we could deal with us
in one of three ways.

516
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,857
Option one, I could apologize,
you could forgive me

517
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:12,090
and come home and we could
move on with our lives like adults.

518
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:15,621
Or, option two,

519
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,726
I could apologize,
you could forgive me, come home,

520
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:22,330
but you can still bring it up
to use against me whenever we argue.

521
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,069
Are you trying to be funny?

522
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,304
Satan has a sense of humor.

523
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,278
What's the third?

524
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,909
I don't know what the third option is.

525
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,159
I just know I still love you.

526
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:00,000
Tell them the chief said
to put a rush on this biopsy

527
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,046
- and tell them it's Ellis Grey.
- OK.

528
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,006
Dr. Burke, do you want
the histologic grade and staging

529
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,644
- or any specific stains?
- Have them run all tests.

530
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,709
OK.

531
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,710
What happened?

532
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,414
You had an extrauterine pregnancy.

533
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,148
Your left fallopian tube burst.

534
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,285
Dr. Shepherd...

535
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:57,700
she did everything she could,
but there was too much damage.

536
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,397
She couldn't save the tube.

537
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,118
- Hey.
- Hey.

538
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:20,351
- Is it over?
- Mm-hm. The surgery was successful.

539
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,655
We're just doing a follow-up.

540
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,356
Dr. Shepherd will be in
to check on you in a while.

541
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,366
- Say that again.
- What?

542
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,995
Say his name. Dr. Shepherd...

543
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,434
Oh my God, look at my face.

544
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:44,043
Dr. Shepherd.

545
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,218
Guess it was worth the risk.

546
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,948
I still think it's nuts
having major surgery

547
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,551
just so people can't tell
how you're feeling.

548
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,699
- Really? You do?
- Nah, I guess not.

549
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,533
You can talk, you know.
I mean, if you need to.

550
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,697
I'm fine.

551
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,037
You've said that word
so many times today,

552
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,543
it doesn't even sound
like a word anymore.

553
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,408
I'm just saying you can talk to me.

554
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,541
Even if I repeat every word, no one here
likes me, they'd just call me a liar.

555
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,608
Izzie likes you.

556
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,721
- You're blushing.
- Shut up.

557
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:31,686
Look, for what it's worth, I don't know
how you're still on your feet.

558
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:35,596
If I found out my mom might have cancer,
I'd be under the bar right now.

559
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,663
You want the ugly truth?

560
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,897
You have an ugly truth?

561
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,736
I never would have picked you
to have an ugly truth.

562
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,436
I'm more afraid she doesn't have cancer.

563
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,809
Well, liver cancer's fast.

564
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,316
Painful, but it's fast
and they give you morphine.

565
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,250
They don't give you morphine
for Alzheimer's.

566
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,310
No, they don't.

567
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,158
What kind of person
wishes their mother had cancer?

568
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,259
It's hard.

569
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:18,038
I know it's hard
being the one who's gone.

570
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:27,809
But, man, it isn't easy
being the one who's still around.

571
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,694
Hey. Did you get
your mom's biopsy results back?

572
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,391
- Not yet.
- How's Cristina?

573
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,602
She's going to have a lot of pain
for a few days, but she'll be OK.

574
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,175
I'm glad you were there.

575
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,041
- Are you?
- Yes. I am.

576
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,948
It's just...
It's just that a lot of the time,

577
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:06,046
it feels like you and Cristina
are kind of over there and I'm here.

578
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,158
- So about Alex.
- Yeah, I know.

579
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,391
I know, you guys hate him. Fine.

580
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,567
Yeah, we do, but I just want to say
that I believe you.

581
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:23,266
That he's different
once you get to know him.

582
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,200
Here you go. Ellis Grey.

583
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,049
Let her know.

584
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,794
Meredith, are you OK?

585
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:49,026
No. I'm not OK.

586
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,733
Dr. Grey?

587
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:01,441
Oh, please, Thatcher.
I've had a long day. I'm tired. Go away.

588
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,638
No!

589
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,610
- What?
- No.

590
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,749
I am Thatcher Grey.

591
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,816
And I'm your husband.

592
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,886
And I know you don't like me very much,

593
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:25,402
but the fact is I don't always
like you very much either.

594
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,238
I don't like the way you speak to me.

595
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,835
And I really hate the way
you speak to Meredith.

596
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,607
She deserves better from you.

597
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,645
I'm sorry.

598
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,389
- You are?
- What's wrong with me, Thatch?

599
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,055
- The mass on your liver...
- Is it algebra?

600
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:58,128
I mean, is it algeb... Damn it!

601
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,574
Is it malignant?

602
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:10,144
No. It's benign.

603
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,256
Meredith?

604
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,428
- Meredith...
- Don't.

605
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:34,362
Please, please just don't say anything.

606
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,172
OK.

607
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:53,389
I'm just exhausted.

608
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,721
My mother is exhausting.

609
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,193
What happened to Cristina.

610
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,889
And you.

611
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,894
Hating you is the most exhausting.

612
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,775
I don't want to do it anymore.

613
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,881
<i> No one likes to lose control.</i>

614
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,115
<i>But as a surgeon,</i>
<i>there's nothing worse.</i>

615
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,896
<i>It's a sign of weakness.</i>

616
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,698
<i>Of not being up to the task.</i>

617
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:50,304
How can someone be so offensive and
yet so charming all at the same time?

618
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,246
It's an art form.

619
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,985
<i> And still, there are times</i>
<i>when it just gets away from you.</i>

620
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,788
<i>When the world stops spinning</i>

621
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:12,165
<i>and you realize that your shiny</i>
<i>little scalpel isn't gonna save you.</i>

622
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:15,694
We went in expecting
to simply remove the tumor.

623
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,139
Instead it was
a little more complicated.

624
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,807
The tumor infiltrated
into the pericardium,

625
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,439
causing a tear in the
outer muscle of the heart.

626
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,910
That's a lot of medical talk.

627
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,921
It means, uh...

628
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:40,461
It means that you had a broken heart.
Literally.

629
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,161
But now I'm...

630
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,240
But now you're going to be fine.

631
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,783
<i> No matter how hard</i>
<i>you fight it, you fall.</i>

632
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,083
<i>And it's scary as hell.</i>

633
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:13,190
<i>Except, if there's an upside</i>
<i>to free falling,</i>

634
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,631
<i>it's the chance you give your friends</i>
<i>to catch you.</i>
