00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,662
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:03,794
That was amazing.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,361
Meredith won't be an issue.
She's out of my life.

4
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:07,599
Goodbye, Derek.

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,437
Think about moving in with me.

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,875
She likes you.
Don't let the syph get in the way.

7
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,277
I like you, Olivia.
I just don't like you enough.

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,281
Do you feel like doing it now?

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,009
You're married?

10
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,884
I'm pregnant, you blind moron.

11
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,481
- How much sodium did you give?
- 500 cc's over 4 hours.

12
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,822
Why didn't you follow up?
I gave you one thing to do.

13
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,953
I have a lot to teach
if you want to learn.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,488
So when you decide how important
it is for you to hate me, let me know.

15
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,057
Dorie Russell, giving birth to quints.

16
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,696
We're gonna need
all the hands we can get.

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,376
<i> 40 years ago The Beatles</i>
<i>asked the world a simple question.</i>

18
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,439
<i>They wanted to know</i>
<i>where all the lonely people came from.</i>

19
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:55,079
<i>My latest theory is that a great many of</i>
<i>the lonely people come from hospitals.</i>

20
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,989
<i>More precisely,</i>
<i>the surgical wing of hospitals.</i>

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,085
I have the best quint.
Lucy. She just smiled at me.

22
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,562
- She's nine hours old, George.
- I'm saying.

23
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,431
There are five babies here and
clearly mine is the advanced one.

24
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,661
Charlotte's smart.

25
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,466
She's got wrinkles on her forehead.
Very serious.

26
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,736
OK, A: this is not a competition,

27
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,505
and B:
my quint kicks your quints' asses.

28
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,069
Emily's strong,
she won't let go of my finger.

29
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:24,480
Hey, Julie has her organs
on the outside of her body

30
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,712
and she's still alive, thank you.

31
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,481
Kate's the best one.

32
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,387
- Izzie.
- Leave.

33
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,324
Can we please just talk?

34
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,886
You're too busy screwing nurses to talk.
Just get out.

35
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,098
Can someone make sure

36
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,260
- that Kate's vitals remain stable?
- I will.

37
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,567
He is unbelievable.
I am so glad I never slept with him,

38
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,631
which is his loss,
because I'm really good in bed.

39
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,234
Mind-blowing.
Mind-blowingly good in bed.

40
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,779
Are you trying to seduce us?

41
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,078
And then he sleeps with Olivia
instead of me. Olivia.

42
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,746
- Hey, I slept with Olivia.
- Well, then you both have bad taste.

43
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:05,484
You can't say that you weren't warned.
Alex has always been Alex.

44
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,391
You dodged a bullet, Iz.
You're better off without him.

45
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,395
Why are you even surprised?

46
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,591
You sleep with a snake, you get bit.

47
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:17,295
Thanks, guys... for the support.

48
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,838
- Who's on call tonight?
- I am.

49
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,501
All right.
The rest of you, go home, sleep.

50
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,340
All five quints are still alive.
It's a good day.

51
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,245
<i>As surgeons we ignore our own needs</i>

52
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,579
<i>so we can meet our patients' needs.</i>

53
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,484
<i>We ignore our friends and families</i>

54
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,250
<i>so we can save</i>
<i>other people's friends and families.</i>

55
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:42,351
<i>Which means that at the end of the day,</i>
<i>all we really have is ourselves.</i>

56
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:48,359
<i>And nothing in this world</i>
<i>can make you feel more alone than that.</i>

57
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,633
I made breakfast.

58
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,373
I don't have time for breakfast.

59
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,743
I've gotta round
before everyone else does

60
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,942
if I wanna get the good cases.
You know that.

61
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,280
Right.

62
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,322
Well... coffee?

63
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,333
Bye.

64
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,339
So I was thinking, we...
I mean, me and you, could maybe

65
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,742
go to Joe's later
to talk by ourselves...

66
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:36,304
- Why should I move?
- You live on a campground.

67
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,976
It's 40 acres of
the most beautiful land in Seattle.

68
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,078
I didn't give up a Central Park
brownstone to live in the forest.

69
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,715
Our house in the Hamptons had trees.

70
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,385
- They were The Hamptons.
- Why are you pointing?

71
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,486
- I'm sorry. What were you saying?
- Oh, nothing.

72
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,396
- Anybody have any food?
- You should eat breakfast.

73
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,901
God, you sound like Burke.

74
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,770
You know, sometimes I think
we'd be better off with dogs.

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,070
Preaching to the choir. I'm over men.

76
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,609
Real nice.

77
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:09,614
You know, a dog is not
a replacement for a human being.

78
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,515
You better wake her.
If Bailey catches her, she's dead.

79
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,576
Izzie.

80
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,848
- Izzie.
- Damn it.

81
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,787
What?

82
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:21,918
Hell hath no fury like a girl whose
non-boyfriend screws a nurse.

83
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,019
Bitch.

84
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,996
I like you bitter and pissed off.

85
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,728
You're almost like a normal person now.

86
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,395
OK, what do we got?

87
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,498
Karl Murphy, 52.
Multiple skin melanomas.

88
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,477
Underwent surgery to his nose, ear, and
a skin graft to the left index finger.

89
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,605
- How's the capillary refill?
- Slow, about four seconds.

90
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,674
What do you recommend
to get that blood moving again?

91
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,745
At this stage, our best option's
probably a biotherapeutic agent.

92
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,215
What... What is that?

93
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,855
- We put leeches on your face.
- Leeches? You don't say?

94
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,367
They secrete blood thinners that break
up pooled blood so it can be evacuated.

95
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,426
It's sort of like a big drain.

96
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,064
- If this makes you uncomfortable...
- No, no.

97
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,576
I've been a hiker for 40 years,
almost 40 years, yeah.

98
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,079
Mother Nature hasn't come up
with anything yet I haven't loved.

99
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,012
You a big outdoorsman?

100
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:20,018
How do you think I got all these
melanomas in the first place?

101
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,282
Oh, Dr. Shepherd. You're in early.

102
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,824
- If you'd like us to come back...
- No. Go ahead.

103
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:30,090
Robert Martin, 45, collapsed and hit
his head, causing a small hemorrhage.

104
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,630
That was the problem.

105
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,862
Mr. Martin was found to have
a Rathke's Cleft cyst on his pituitary,

106
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,564
and surgery was postponed when...

107
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,301
- When I told a nurse...
- Olivia.

108
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,641
When I told a nurse to administer an
incorrect dosage of hypertonic saline.

109
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,305
Dehydrating his brain.

110
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,815
He still has a chance.
He could wake up and be fine.

111
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,113
- There's a chance.
- I know I screwed up.

112
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:57,122
- Just put me back on this case, please.
- There's not much of a case left.

113
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,715
You saw to that.
You want back on? Be my guest.

114
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,702
Oh, good. Here you are.

115
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,715
Mom and Dad are anxious for an update.
Dr. Yang?

116
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:27,378
We've done the initial surgery
on Julie's omphalocele.

117
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:31,355
A primary closure was attempted
but there was pulmonary compromise

118
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:35,520
- so we couldn't continue...
- Yang, do this in plain English.

119
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:39,861
Oh, we operated
on Julie's external sac of organs.

120
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,264
We pushed in
as much of the bowel as we could

121
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,600
and we think we can push in the rest
with a second operation.

122
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,697
- She has to have a second operation?
- Yeah.

123
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:53,142
- Uh... Well, not for a few days.
- Dr. O'Malley?

124
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,443
We put in Lucy's brain shunt yesterday
and she's doing very well.

125
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:00,008
We have to keep monitoring to make sure
the spinal fluid doesn't back up.

126
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,384
- Stevens?
- Dr. Burke used a catheter

127
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,923
to open Emily's atrial septum
last night.

128
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,290
Today, we'll try to reconstruct
the left chamber of her heart.

129
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,761
- We're very hopeful.
- Dr. Grey?

130
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,924
Charlotte's lungs were
less developed than the others',

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,867
so we put a special mask on her
to help her breathe

132
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,131
and we're monitoring her closely.

133
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,140
- That just leaves Kate.
- She seems to be pretty healthy.

134
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,641
No major issues identified,

135
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,872
but we'll keep her in the Isolette
until she reaches four pounds.

136
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,279
You hear that, honey?
Kate's doing really well.

137
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,579
I'll be in my room.

138
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:39,053
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Tom, she's just had five babies.

139
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,152
Her hormones are all over the place.
Give her time. She'll come around.

140
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,227
Grey, watch the mother. Make sure
her hormones don't get the best of her.

141
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,000
- I can look out for Dorie.
- No, you have Emily's heart surgery.

142
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,974
- But I have a relationship with Dorie.
- Why are you arguing?

143
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,443
- Why am I being pushed off...
- Hey, Stevens.

144
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,107
I don't know what you're angry about,
but I don't care. Keep it to yourself.

145
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:07,448
On top of every other patient under
our care, we have quints to worry about.

146
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,650
These are preemies. They should have
spent another eight weeks in the womb.

147
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,191
Like interns...

148
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,056
...they're not ready for the real world.

149
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,927
Oh, it's the pit. Yang, come with me.

150
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:24,033
Constance Ferguson, 40, inmate at
Henderson, swallowed a razor blade.

151
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:28,437
- Attempted suicide?
- Attempted field trip. Worked too.

152
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,806
All right.

153
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,736
- Field trip?
- Says on her chart she was in solitary.

154
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,975
- This is her way out.
- Oh, is she crazy?

155
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,381
Only if you'd call a murderer crazy.

156
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,943
Yeah, baby,
that's what I'm talking about!

157
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,224
Ms. Ferguson,
are you experiencing any discomfort?

158
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,793
You mean apart from these snazzy
handcuffs you got pinching my wrists?

159
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,896
Did you at least put tape on the blade?

160
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,136
- I'm not an idiot.
- You swallowed a razor blade.

161
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,236
- Not going to tell me what hurts?
- And shorten my vacation?

162
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,578
You're standing around. Why not
get me some chocolate pudding?

163
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,641
Make the blade go down smoother.

164
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,814
Get an X-ray. Portable. With prisoners
we have to minimize flight risk.

165
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,451
I'm supposed to check on Julie. You said
we're to keep a close eye on the quints.

166
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,519
Julie's my quint too.
I got that covered. You do this.

167
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,998
- Are you sure you can't do it?
- I can. I choose not to.

168
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,433
Come on, baby,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

169
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,499
I only murdered three people
and none of them were doctors.

170
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,207
- Olivia.
- Dr. O'Malley.

171
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,579
- How are the leeches doing?
- They're not. Can't get them to bite.

172
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,380
With all this blood?
Should be a no-brainer for a leech.

173
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,388
They can get anxious.
Bright lights, thunderstorms...

174
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,253
Oh!

175
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,351
- Nervous handlers.
- I'm sorry. I should be better at this.

176
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,919
I still get a little squeamish
around leeches.

177
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,431
That is not what I have heard.

178
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,266
Dr. O'Malley can take over from here.

179
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,931
Whoa, whoa. What was that all about?

180
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,135
Nothing.

181
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,974
<i> Dr. Frank to Oncology.</i>

182
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,206
OK.

183
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,116
There we are. He's in.

184
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,862
I had no idea that
you and Alex were a couple.

185
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,905
It's just...

186
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:44,068
I was having a bad day
and it was good to have someone...

187
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,744
To talk to, I mean, not good to...

188
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,372
Alex really is good.

189
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,819
I mean, he's good in the way
he's a good person, good.

190
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,584
Not the other kind of good.

191
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,354
You know, "good in bed" good.

192
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,429
Which he is, as I'm sure you know.

193
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,199
But...

194
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,735
OK. Well, bye.

195
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,115
- Any temperature spikes?
- No fever. Vitals are stable.

196
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,207
Very good.

197
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,309
- Go ahead, after you.
- Thanks.

198
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:36,388
- So, you're giving up the trailer?
- I'm not giving up the trailer.

199
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,794
Is Addison telling people
that I'm giving it up?

200
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,129
It's just funny. I just would never
have pegged you for that guy.

201
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,190
What guy?

202
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,638
You know, the marbled bath,
private pool, gated community guy.

203
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,473
- Don't peg me. I'm not peggable.
- You're pegged. Deal with it.

204
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,505
- BP's low. She's tachycardic.
- SATS?

205
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,606
Dropping on high-flow O2.

206
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,318
- No breathing sounds.
- Her lung collapsed.

207
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,017
- Should I call Addison?
- No time.

208
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,289
Stick this between her second
and third rib. Do not go too deep.

209
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,921
You're going to hear
a small gush of air.

210
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,967
I heard it.

211
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,003
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

212
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,711
- I'm not giving up the trailer.
- Whatever you say, Dr Shepherd.

213
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,085
- Her lung collapsed?
- And I know it sounds scary,

214
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,559
but it's really not that uncommon
in a preemie this size.

215
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,461
So, we've inserted a tube
into Charlotte's chest

216
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,797
and that will help her breathe
until her lung can stay up on its own.

217
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,963
Mrs. Russell...

218
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,472
She really is doing fine now.

219
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,441
That's me. I gotta go.

220
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:03,505
My mom can only handle the triplets
for half a day. She's 74 so...

221
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,477
- I'll call you when I get home, OK?
- Hmm.

222
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,352
I love you.

223
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,889
- Could you...
- I'll keep an eye on her.

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,161
- Thank you.
- OK.

225
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,995
<i> Dr. Prunella to ICU, stat.</i>

226
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:31,634
Dorie... this isn't your fault.

227
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,940
You can't blame yourself for this.

228
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,417
I've got one baby who can barely breathe
and one with half a heart.

229
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,711
Two of the others are...

230
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:51,224
If I'd listened to the doctors
I could have had three healthy girls

231
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,925
instead of four
who might not live until tomorrow.

232
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,160
It was my decision.

233
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,032
Tom agreed with the doctors.

234
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,232
So, really, Dr. Grey...

235
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,800
who else should I blame?

236
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,540
First step in the Norwood
is cardiopulmonary bypass.

237
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,075
With HLHS, what else do you get
besides hypoplasia of the ventricle?

238
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,021
Stenosis or atresia
of the mitral and aortic valves.

239
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,459
Why use the RV-PA conduit instead of
the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt?

240
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:27,488
- It limits diastolic runoff.
- Well, you've done your homework.

241
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,797
I was on call last night.
I study when I'm on call.

242
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,303
Well, no matter what the books say,

243
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:39,140
I guarantee you
you've never seen a heart this small.

244
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,943
Bet you I have.

245
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:50,216
How you doing, you?
You know, I'm having a baby too.

246
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,224
Yes, I am. A little boy.

247
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,351
Maybe you can meet him someday.

248
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,918
How's that sound?
Does that sound good?

249
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,625
We could...

250
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,533
Pregnancy has not made me soft.

251
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,938
I haven't gone soft. I don't do soft.

252
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,172
Of course not.
You were just talking to a patient.

253
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,839
- What's this?
- The inmate's X-rays.

254
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:22,783
That foolish, foolish woman.
She swallowed four razor blades?

255
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,083
Mm-hm.

256
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,993
Hey! Hey, you! Hey, Nurse!

257
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,296
- Would you keep it down, please?
- I'm starving.

258
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,860
You're NPO. No food allowed.

259
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,375
Come on, April, baby, don't go for him.
He's such an idiot.

260
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,839
I didn't come here to starve to death.
I want mint-chocolate-chip ice cream.

261
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:54,079
Mint, OK? Not Rocky Road. You better
not get me that Rocky Road. It sucks.

262
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,850
Thank God. Mama Bear,
help me out here, OK? I'm starving.

263
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,322
Don't give her anything.

264
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,827
Right there you're in official violation
of the Eighth Amendment.

265
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,921
You can't eat because
you're about to undergo major surgery.

266
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,023
What? What's she talking about?

267
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,364
You're at risk
for a perforated intestine

268
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,803
and half a dozen kinds of infection.
We need to operate right away.

269
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:18,309
I don't need an operation. I taped up
the blade. It passes the next day.

270
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,141
- What's the big deal?
- You swallowed four blades.

271
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,976
That's the big deal.

272
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,846
I thought it would buy me an extra day.

273
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,120
Does this operation
have a nice long recovery time?

274
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,786
You realize this is major surgery?
It's dangerous and you could die.

275
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,224
Mint chocolate chip.

276
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,360
I want at least a gallon after you
ghouls are done splitting me open.

277
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,702
What exactly is it that we're doing?

278
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,334
We're visiting.

279
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,709
We've thrown
all this medical talk at you

280
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,513
and outlined worst-case scenarios, which
has probably scared you half to death.

281
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:04,147
The one thing we haven't done is given
you a chance to be with your daughters.

282
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,157
Well, how is that going to help?

283
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:10,321
If I've learned anything, these past few
days, it's that I need to face reality.

284
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,694
Here's Kate. You can reach in
and touch her if you like.

285
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,062
I would like to very much.

286
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,374
Charlotte's not breathing.

287
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,651
Page Addison. She's in the OR.

288
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,378
We didn't see this on the echo.

289
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,050
You can never get an exact measurement.

290
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,854
What?

291
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,656
The baby's aorta
is narrower than we thought.

292
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,631
Diameter is only a millimeter.

293
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,566
- Just not getting enough blood flow.
- Damn.

294
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,304
I wanted you to see,
before I close up.

295
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,003
You didn't do anything.

296
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,103
- Dr. Stevens.
- We barely started.

297
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,139
Dr. Burke has done all he can for now,
so unless you know how to do a Norwood,

298
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,084
he's gonna close this baby's chest.

299
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:18,394
- You OK?
- I'm fine. May I go?

300
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,694
Yes.

301
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,800
- What happened?
- She had an apneic episode.

302
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,340
She's still not breathing on her own.

303
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,502
Intubate and give surfactant.

304
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,707
Push 0.1 of atropine
and three milligrams of ketamine.

305
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,342
- Meds are in.
- Tube.

306
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,819
OK. Place the CO2 detector.

307
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,554
- She was fine with the chest tube.
- That's the thing with RDS cases.

308
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:54,292
Just when you think the baby's
getting better, they slip right back.

309
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,630
Breath sounds equal. Good.

310
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,728
Mrs. Russell.

311
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,747
Unbelievable.
Who would do this to themselves?

312
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:15,810
The woman wasn't just in prison, Yang,
she was in solitary.

313
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,516
Well, she was seriously deranged.

314
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:23,391
You try spending a month locked
in a room with no windows,

315
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,920
no one to talk to for 23 hours a day.

316
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,990
See how deranged she is then.

317
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,696
- Dr. Bailey, she's a murderer.
- I didn't say she wasn't.

318
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,329
One, two, three.

319
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:39,366
I said, try having no one to make your
snarky comments to for a solid month.

320
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:43,540
My guess is
you'd swallow the entire razor.

321
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:49,117
- How are they treating you, Mr Murphy?
- I've done worse for company.

322
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,452
Oh, they're definitely filling up.

323
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,287
Tissue is getting nice and pink.

324
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,123
Make up with that
cute little girlfriend of yours yet?

325
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,187
Olivia's hardly my girlfriend.

326
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,160
- Is she OK?
- She?

327
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,500
Yeah, Isabella.

328
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,064
This one here on my finger...

329
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,837
that's Darcy.

330
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,743
And that little guy on my nose,
named O'Malley.

331
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,782
That's right, I named him after you.

332
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,908
You're the one that got him to bite.

333
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,215
Isabella is fine. She's just full.

334
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,688
Oh. Wait,
what are you going to with her?

335
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,555
She's done her job. We don't have
any more use for her.

336
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,619
- Except as medical waste.
- No.

337
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,791
I'd like to keep her... if I could.

338
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,396
Crazy nature man. You want to take a
leech home as a pet? That's fine.

339
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,464
You had no right
to speak to me that way.

340
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,840
Yeah? Well, you hurt my friend.

341
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,847
I had no idea Alex was seeing Izzie.
That's not what you're upset about.

342
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,576
You have no idea why I'm upset.

343
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,552
Besides, you know what
I don't understand is, why Alex?

344
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,213
And why again?

345
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,221
People get Ionely, George.

346
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,663
Hi, Mr. Russell?
It's Meredith Grey calling.

347
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,094
I was wondering if there was any chance

348
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,035
maybe you could bring
your boys by to visit their mom?

349
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,369
I think she could use the company.

350
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:20,300
Oh, the flu?
No, definitely don't bring them.

351
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,108
Thank you. You too.

352
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,418
You've been lying low.

353
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:34,289
Well, nobody's talking to me
so it makes it kind of easy, right?

354
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,463
I'm talking to you.

355
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,432
In short monosyllabic sentences
laced with disdain and contempt.

356
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,561
So, what, according to girl rules,
now you all have to hate me?

357
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,664
I don't hate you. If my mother hadn't
gotten Alzheimer's, I'd probably be you.

358
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,505
- Oh, really?
- Really.

359
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,910
Before she got sick, I mean, I...
I'd finished college,

360
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:01,112
but I was partying way too much,
staying out way too late to keep a job.

361
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,553
At family reunions everybody
was embarrassed to talk about me.

362
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,614
So that's what you think of me?

363
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,321
Are you OK?

364
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,058
- I almost killed a guy yesterday.
- Mr. Martin?

365
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,293
I'm trying to find
anything I can to help.

366
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,132
OK, well, what are we looking for?

367
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,765
Uh, anything on central
pontine myelinolysis.

368
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,908
- Unbelievable.
- Izzie.

369
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,847
- Izzie, come on.
- "Come on?"

370
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,554
You're fraternizing with the enemy
and you tell me to "come on?"

371
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,256
- Alex and I are sort of friends.
- Since when?

372
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,265
Since when are you and Alex friends?

373
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,167
You tell me to cut my losses,
and as soon as I turn my back...

374
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,297
- You're making too big a deal of this.
- Right. Of course.

375
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,572
I'm the unreasonable one. Do what
you want. Sleep with him for all I care.

376
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,976
Obviously I'm not going
to sleep with him.

377
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,675
Why not?
You've slept with everyone else.

378
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,626
Your surgery went smoothly. You'll
have abdominal pain for a day or two...

379
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:22,030
- Just a day or two?
- We'll watch until your bowels move.

380
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,365
- The average is about 36 hours.
- 36?

381
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,997
Four razor blades
and that's all you can give me?

382
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,633
Come on, sugarplum,
I thought we were having fun.

383
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,473
- Don't leave.
- What?

384
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,672
Just maybe a little conversation?

385
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,843
They've got me here by myself. I thought
I'd have a room mate to talk to.

386
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,442
OK.

387
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,782
Why did you kill three people?

388
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,520
Start off with a little small talk,
why don't you?

389
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,255
I was high.

390
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,629
On meth.

391
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,999
And I had this boyfriend who...

392
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,905
had this robbery all planned out.

393
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:09,142
He said that he would leave me
if I didn't help him.

394
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,482
Things got out of control.

395
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,777
He was gonna leave me.

396
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,957
He was all I had.

397
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,016
I would have been all alone.

398
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,759
Clearly, being alone has its benefits.

399
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,800
You paged me?

400
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,472
A leech fell off
and I can't get the new one to bite.

401
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,105
I'm sorry, they freak me out.

402
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,151
- I'm a surgeon, Olivia.
- You're an intern, George.

403
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,584
You know what time it is?

404
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,156
Time for you two kids to kiss
and make up, that's what time it is.

405
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,627
Mr. Murphy, we are not a couple.

406
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,664
Oh, you can't pull much over on me.

407
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,291
I say there's something
between the two of you.

408
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,535
You're right, Mr. Murphy, there was.

409
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,971
Olivia, this isn't the time
and this really isn't the place.

410
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,100
He broke up with me for a girl
who doesn't know he's alive.

411
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,145
- She does know.
- You, Meredith Grey?

412
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,702
Never gonna happen.

413
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,181
- Why would you think it's Meredith?
- Anyone paying attention

414
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,718
knows how you feel about her.

415
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,618
Except Meredith,
which should tell you something.

416
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,815
Sorry, Mr. Murphy.

417
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,554
She gave me syphilis.

418
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,031
Remember what you did to me
when I was an intern?

419
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,692
How could I forget?

420
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,965
You didn't speak to me
for almost a year.

421
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,938
But you learned.

422
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:45,636
Yeah, well, I think I gotta do that
to Izzie Stevens.

423
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,670
Well, she's smart, hard-working. Gets
a little too involved with her patients.

424
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,979
- A lot like you.
- I know.

425
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,078
It took me a long time to recover.

426
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,521
But it made you a better surgeon,
Addison.

427
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:03,322
The question is, is she talented enough
to make the lesson worth it?

428
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,229
She's the best I've seen in years.
I was hoping that we could...

429
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,030
You're not here to make friends.
You're here to make better surgeons.

430
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,764
And being the teacher
can be a Ionely business.

431
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,108
I'm telling you,
Meredith was all over him.

432
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,409
Seriously? She was all over him?

433
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,711
Mounting him? With the babies watching?

434
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,446
She would have been
if I hadn't interrupted.

435
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,081
- She was talking to him.
- You don't talk to bastards who cheat.

436
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,489
- You weren't his girlfriend.
- Not the point.

437
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,460
It is. I don't get emotional
over people I'm not dating.

438
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,928
Really?

439
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,726
You want to go there?

440
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,602
- No.
- I am having a moment here.

441
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,069
Don't mess with me.

442
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,232
You're not gonna have
a nervous breakdown or kill yourself?

443
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,367
No.

444
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,607
So... there's no chance you'll kill us?

445
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,176
- Oh, that was wrong on so many levels.
- So good.

446
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:06,087
- That was... That was good.
- It was good. It was good.

447
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,992
Your lungs are not good.

448
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:17,864
I know we got you out of there a little
earlier than you would have wanted.

449
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,166
We have to find something to help you.

450
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,139
So, if you have any ideas, Charlotte...

451
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,178
- Dr. Stevens.
- Dr. Shepherd.

452
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,486
- Something you need?
- Yes, Dr. Burke and I have reassessed.

453
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,287
There's a chance with the Norwood

454
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,760
if Emily can make it through
the next ten hours.

455
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:49,095
- Would you look after her tonight?
- I was on call last night.

456
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,362
- But, I mean, yeah, of course.
- Good.

457
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:55,463
I've left a list of meds, and you're
familiar with pediatric life support?

458
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,667
Got certified
soon as I got in the program.

459
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:58,800
OK, then.

460
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,345
Anything else I should know
to look out for?

461
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,643
No. That should do it.

462
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,775
- Should I notify Mrs. Russell...
- No. I've done that.

463
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,787
Dr. Stevens,
this baby is your responsibility.

464
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,552
- She better be alive when I get back.
- OK.

465
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,754
I found studies where they
used aggressive plasmapheresis.

466
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:25,234
- This could work on Mr. Martin.
- Those were all isolated cases.

467
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,533
The studies
resulted in improved symptoms.

468
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:30,199
No trials have been done.
There is nothing you can do.

469
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,970
- What about thyrotropin?
- No.

470
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,240
- There's European studies...
- Karev, it's over. You screwed up.

471
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,338
You fried Mr. Martin's brain.

472
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:41,818
He wakes up; you put him in
a wheelchair. He dies; you killed him.

473
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,717
Deal with it.

474
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:55,464
Dr. Stevens, the baby's VO2
is still 40 per cent after transfusion.

475
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,900
- How's her BP doing?
- Still low. Last systolic was 52.

476
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,871
OK, I'm going to push
30cc's of NS manually.

477
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,009
Nice start. Pressure's 65.

478
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,584
- Hey, Iz.
- OK, really?

479
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,956
You think I'm talking to you?

480
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,825
Well, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

481
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,990
What are you sorry for?

482
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:34,032
When Derek broke up with you, I never
said "You're better off without him."

483
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,596
It's not supportive, it's condescending.

484
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:42,112
I was there. All I ever am is there for
you guys, and the one time I need you...

485
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,308
Just... go away, Meredith.

486
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,417
She was fine
then she just started seizing.

487
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,297
She's not seizing, she's choking.

488
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,403
Oh, my God. She swallowed a light bulb.

489
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,318
- We're losing her.
- Don't you think I can see that?

490
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,624
She needs an airway.

491
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,438
She's clamped down. I can't intubate.
We need some help in here!

492
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,639
- Want me to get paralytics?
- No, she'll be dead by then.

493
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,841
I need a scalpel for a crich.

494
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,544
- Have you done one ever?
- Of course not! Go!

495
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:58,749
I was gonna do a crich.

496
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,758
- How long has she been unconscious?
- She just went down.

497
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:06,286
Prep OR Two. Emergency thoracotomy.
Cristina, it'll be OK. Come on.

498
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,661
- She's coding.
- Again?

499
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,000
OK, uh...
Turn up... Turn up the epi drip.

500
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,174
OK.

501
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,079
OK.

502
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,582
OK.

503
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:39,752
- Hey, Dorie. What are you doing?
- I'm packing.

504
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,197
You've just had major abdominal surgery.

505
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,065
- You're not in any condition...
- I'm going home.

506
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:49,402
I need to go home. I can't be here.
I can't watch them die.

507
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,767
They're not dying.
They're trying to live.

508
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,110
You leaving them
isn't going to help them.

509
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,911
- I have boys who need me.
- Your daughters need you.

510
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,885
Don't you understand that I can't do it?

511
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,983
I can't do it.

512
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,390
- They're too sick.
- Which is why they need their mother.

513
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:15,023
- If Emily dies I...
- If Emily dies it will be horrible.

514
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,067
But if Emily dies and you're not here?

515
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,067
- I can't even hold them.
- But you can sit with them

516
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,608
and talk to them.

517
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,476
And let them know they're not alone
in this world. That's all they need.

518
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,480
That's all anybody...

519
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,109
- What?
- I think I know how to help Charlotte.

520
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,860
I don't know why
I didn't think of this sooner.

521
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,091
- What are you doing?
- Co-bedding.

522
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:52,626
Hospitals sometimes do it with twins
when one of them is sick.

523
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:56,196
- And the other one gets better?
- It helps.

524
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,368
- How?
- We don't really know.

525
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:04,746
Sometimes babies get stressed
in the ICUs from all the activity.

526
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,183
This way there's someone there
to comfort them.

527
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,413
To be there with them.

528
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:22,063
Excellent blood flow at all three
places. You're healing nicely.

529
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,034
- And I like my new nose.
- Your wife will like it, too.

530
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,664
I'm not so sure what she'll say
about your new houseguests.

531
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,642
I'm going to let these guys go in the
lake near my favorite hiking trail.

532
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,407
They saved my face. The least I can
do for 'em. And I don't have a wife.

533
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:41,714
- I'm sorry. Your wedding ring...
- I'm divorced. Just never took it off.

534
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:47,657
By the way... sorry you had
to see that little scene earlier.

535
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,226
Talking with the girl
who isn't your girlfriend

536
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,661
about the girl
you'd like to be your girlfriend?

537
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:54,755
Yeah.

538
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,665
She shouldn't have said that stuff.
It was just...

539
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,260
She was very unprofessional.

540
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,867
Yeah, but is it true?

541
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,144
Do you like this Meredith?

542
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,340
I don't think that's really
any of your business.

543
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,849
She's OK.

544
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,417
I like her OK.

545
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,355
All right. I love her.

546
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,829
Oh, come on. Don't be embarrassed.

547
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,093
I loved my wife.

548
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,829
But sometimes, no matter how much
you love someone,

549
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,167
they just can't love you back
in the same way.

550
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:42,079
Believe me, son, livin' with a woman
who can't love you back?

551
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,614
Way Ionelier than bein' alone.

552
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,707
What do you wanna do?

553
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,252
- We can... we can put her on ECMO.
- Baby this size,

554
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,447
you're risking intracranial hemorrhage.

555
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,582
She's already coded three times.
You page Dr. Shepherd?

556
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,559
She said you have to handle this.

557
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,755
- What? I'm an intern. What is...
- Dr. Stevens...

558
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,061
- Give me a second.
- You don't have a second.

559
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,728
ECMO is too dangerous. We're gonna
have to keep her going on epi.

560
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,931
It'll stop her circulation.
No point keeping her heart rate up

561
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,906
if she doesn't have functioning limbs.

562
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,272
I know that.

563
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,212
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,747
Let's...

565
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,409
We have to keep pushing epi.
It's our best option.

566
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,919
We'll just have to find a middle ground.

567
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,221
You can do this.

568
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,733
I can't believe you would consider
moving out of your trailer.

569
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,801
The view alone.

570
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,973
- See the mist rise off the lake.
- Yeah.

571
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,777
Yeah.

572
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,110
I'm not moving.

573
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,784
- You're still you?
- I'm still me.

574
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,821
Good.

575
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,981
- Where's Emily?
- They took her away.

576
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:28,280
- Where? Why didn't you wake me?
- Dr. Shepherd told us not to.

577
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,684
What?

578
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,586
Where's the baby?

579
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,023
Dr. Stevens, she died half an hour ago.

580
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,653
It wasn't your fault.

581
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,753
You put me in charge.
I fell asleep. I killed that baby.

582
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:12,023
No, you didn't.
She was going to die anyway.

583
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:15,862
She had a restricted atrial septum
and virtually no aorta.

584
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:20,893
As soon as Dr. Burke opened up her
chest, we knew she didn't have a chance.

585
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,503
I don't get it.

586
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,067
You order me to stay the night,
take care of her.

587
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:33,742
I work my ass off doing CPR, pumping
her full of every drug on the planet.

588
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:37,754
God, do you have any idea how scared
I was? And it was all for nothing?

589
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,258
Hardly. This comes up again,
you'll be able to handle the pressure.

590
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,522
- You lied to me.
- You have to learn distance, Stevens.

591
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,563
You'll be a better doctor for it.

592
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,700
A better...

593
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,928
A better doctor?

594
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,716
I heard you worked a miracle last night.

595
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:13,120
She came around so fast I thought
the equipment was malfunctioning.

596
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,785
- Her SATS are completely stable.
- She's going to make it.

597
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,526
Go home, Grey. You've earned it.

598
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,624
Oh, Grey.

599
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,669
Way to go.

600
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,839
Did you hear that? Way to go.

601
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,523
- My baby died.
- We know.

602
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,628
She just... died.

603
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,939
I have an idea.

604
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:33,599
The first person I killed,
I was a second-year resident.

605
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,734
James Hanson.

606
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,706
You should go home, Alex.
There's nothing you can do here.

607
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,582
Nobody should die alone.

608
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,852
<i> 400 years ago</i>

609
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:57,622
<i>another well-known English guy</i>
<i>had an opinion about being alone.</i>

610
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:01,631
<i>John Donne.</i>
<i>He thought we were never alone.</i>

611
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,065
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it was fancier when he said it.</i>

612
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,502
Don't try and talk.

613
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,232
Your windpipe was perforated.

614
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,207
Dr. Burke repaired it
and you should be fine.

615
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:19,847
We'll keep you here
at least ten days for observation.

616
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,010
Make sure there's no infection.

617
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,692
Maybe just to be on the safe side,
we'll make it two weeks.

618
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:39,026
<i>"No man is an island,</i>
<i>entire unto himself. "</i>

619
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:53,072
- Oh, that's him.
- Yeah. That's him.

620
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,056
I'm Ionely, Derek.

621
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,232
<i>Boil down that island talk</i>

622
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,829
<i>and he just meant that all anyone needs</i>
<i>is someone to step in...</i>

623
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,424
<i>... and let us know we're not alone.</i>

624
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,207
Get it. Good boy.

625
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,072
- Ready? Good boy, Doc.
- OK.

626
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:57,136
<i>And who's to say that someone</i>
<i>can't have four legs?</i>

627
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,581
<i>Someone to play with</i>
<i>or run around with...</i>

628
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,017
High jump.

629
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,387
<i>... or just hang out.</i>
