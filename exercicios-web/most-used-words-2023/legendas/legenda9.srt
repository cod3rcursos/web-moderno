00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,026
<i> Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,936
- What will happen when she's on leave?
- A new resident?

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,533
My mother is very sick. I'm the
only person she'll allow to see her.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,372
Cujo has to go!

5
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,809
Hey, Doc. Buddy.

6
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:15,780
- Thanks for doing this.
- He'll be fine.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,876
I grew up in a trailer park. Paid for
med school by posing in my underwear.

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,478
I walk into the OR
and everyone hopes I'm the nurse.

9
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,352
The nurses are overworked.

10
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,891
Sorry, we're short-staffed.

11
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,190
Unhappy nurses lead to...
I don't even want to think about it.

12
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,695
We go on strike in ten days.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,928
<i> In surgery,</i>
<i>there's a red line on the floor</i>

14
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,700
<i>that marks the point where the hospital</i>
<i>goes from being accessible</i>

15
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,572
<i>to being off-limits</i>
<i>to all but a special few.</i>

16
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:47,704
<i>Crossing the line unauthorized</i>
<i>is not tolerated.</i>

17
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,409
Fair hours, fair wages!
Fair hours, fair wages!

18
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:01,523
Can't cross
the picket line. I can't.

19
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:04,222
I don't like it, George,
but what choice do we have?

20
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,527
You took an oath to heal.
You're a healer.

21
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,467
Dad's a truck driver, Mom's a teacher.
The news shows me crossing this line?

22
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,005
They'll outlive me
just to pee on my grave.

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,201
<i> In general,</i>
<i>lines are there for a reason.</i>

24
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:19,575
Has there been any blood yet?
I heard they brought in scab nurses.

25
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,774
<i> For safety. For security.</i>

26
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,373
<i>For clarity.</i>

27
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,854
I think the nurses would know
we are on their side. Don't they?

28
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,915
We're doctors. We have sick patients
inside! I mean, we have surgeries.

29
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,619
OK.

30
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,753
Then you go first.

31
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,264
- Don't cross! Scabs!
- Screw it.

32
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,664
Fair hours! Fair wages!
Fair hours! Fair wages!

33
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:45,568
Yeah, doing my job.
Doing my job. Ha-ha!

34
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:52,604
They threw food at her!
That is just wrong!

35
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,141
Fine. I'm going in.

36
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,811
- Change your own bedpans, Stevens!
- Enjoy your syphilis, Olivia!

37
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,488
- George, are you coming?
- No, I'm good here.

38
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:09,358
<i> If you choose to cross</i>
<i>the line, you do so at your own risk.</i>

39
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,989
- Good morning.
- Morning, Meredith!

40
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,124
- How is she today?
- She's great.

41
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,200
She really lights up
when Dr. Webber visits.

42
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,597
And I did not back down.

43
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:24,131
Not in my OR,
not in front of those jock Ortho idiots.

44
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,738
It was the last time Windsor called you
"little lady." Even behind your back.

45
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,307
One day, I'll be Chief of Surgery.
The first woman Chief. You watch.

46
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,285
I don't doubt it.

47
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,651
<i> So why is it...</i>

48
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,280
Don't doubt for a minute.

49
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:41,851
<i>... that the bigger the line,</i>
<i>the greater the temptation to cross it?</i>

50
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,624
Fair hours, fair wages!
Fair hours, fair wages!

51
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:48,030
And I can't say this enough.
Charts are organized by room number.

52
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,161
I know you're temps,
but there's no excuse for sloppiness.

53
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,364
- Where's Edmonds' chart?
- I need vitals.

54
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,669
Know why I stopped being a nurse?
Doctors.

55
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,801
Doctors who don't know
how to pitch in.

56
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:58,866
Right.

57
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,607
This place is going to hell.
We need the real nurses.

58
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,549
We need 40 nurses to relieve the
overtime that they're striking about.

59
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,779
That's $2 million a year we don't have.

60
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,290
Have you checked under the couch?
I always find spare change there.

61
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,985
OK, I'm silencing myself.

62
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,592
That's him.
He's published twice and he's flawless.

63
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,260
He's a freak.
He doesn't let you speak in the OR.

64
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,429
- Yeah, but he's flawless.
- I think it is him. What's his name?

65
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,530
Oh, yeah. Mouth breather guy.

66
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,599
But he'll let you do a procedure
on your own if he likes you.

67
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,976
- What are we doing?
- Figuring out who'll replace Bailey.

68
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,643
Yang! Stevens! Grey! O'Malley! Karev!
Here you are!

69
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,279
I was looking for you guys in
the locker room, but you weren't there.

70
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,290
Then I thought, "Maybe my interns
are looking for me too."

71
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,485
Then I come out here and here you are.

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,028
Yeah! You guys look like a great group!

73
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,759
Awesome. My horoscope said it was
going to be a very challenging day,

74
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,358
and I was a little worried.
But, no. You guys...

75
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,461
Yeah, you look like a good group.

76
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,497
Which is great because we are going to
have so much fun. Hi! Hi, first of all.

77
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,769
Ow. Ow.

78
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,370
- Sorry. Am I hurting you?
- No, you're touching me.

79
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,011
I'm Sydney Heron. Fourth year.

80
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,213
My philosophy, just so you know,
is, um, is heal with love.

81
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:19,855
OK? So, wonderful.
So, Alex, Izzie, Meredith, Cristina.

82
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,518
Our group is just missing...

83
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,791
O'Malley. He's cowering
behind the strike line like a girl.

84
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:28,960
Standing up for what he believes in,
that's my kind of girl. Right?

85
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,469
The ER needs somebody down there
for a consult.

86
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,062
- Does anybody... Who wants to...
- We get to pick?

87
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,835
- Me! I'm on it!
- I'll help.

88
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,671
I have patients I need to check on.

89
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:41,043
So it looks like just you and me,
Izzie McGee.

90
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,379
All right. It's Stevens.
Izzie Stevens.

91
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,544
Oh, no. I knew!
I was just rhyming.

92
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,180
Oh. Rhyming. Right.
Yeah, that's neat.

93
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,553
- Dr. Stevens?
- Yeah.

94
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,650
- Can I use you on a consult?
- OK, I'm on it! Absolutely.

95
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,160
Yeah.

96
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,457
- You need a consult for a rash?
- It's spreading pretty fast.

97
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,865
I wanted to be sure
there's nothing surgical.

98
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,926
Mrs. Solomon? Oh!

99
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,236
Sorry.

100
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,004
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Yeah.

101
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,738
Sweet.

102
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,679
Can you, um...

103
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,545
...dismount, please?

104
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,141
- Yeah.
- OK, great.

105
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,276
Ah!

106
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,884
Len! Lenny.

107
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,948
Is that you?

108
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,332
Lenny.

109
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,527
Are you OK, ma'am?

110
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,836
"Grace Bickham." Mrs. Bickham,
do you know who your doctor is?

111
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,605
- Len?
- I don't see your chart here.

112
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,375
- Are you there?
- I need you to calm down for me, OK?

113
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,508
- Lenny?
- Is that your husband?

114
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,576
Where is he?
He was here.

115
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,849
I'm sure he'll be back any moment.

116
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,983
You're having trouble breathing.
I need to run some tests.

117
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,324
- Lenny.
- Nurse? I need a nurse in here!

118
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:07,526
Fair hours, fair wages!
Fair hours, fair wages!

119
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,737
You can go, George.

120
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,036
We won't throw donuts.

121
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,703
- I can take the donuts.
- Then what are you doing here?

122
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,838
Teachers' strike of '03?
Mom walked the line for 48 days.

123
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,314
I can't... just... I can't cross.

124
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,545
- So go home.
- I can't go home.

125
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,679
You don't just go...
Yeah, and get kicked out of the program.

126
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,920
Lose my place as a resident.
I'm a doctor. Don't do...

127
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,195
Don't... Don't...

128
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,256
I'm a union guy.

129
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,130
- So that means?
- Give me that sign.

130
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,037
- All right!
- Whoo!

131
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,976
All right, Dr. O'Malley!

132
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,612
Help! I need a nurse in here.
Her pressure's falling.

133
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,123
- She stopped breathing.
- Whoa. Is she dying?

134
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,854
- Are you a nurse?
- I'm, like, a nursing student.

135
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,793
I need to intubate.
Get a 7.5 tube.

136
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,490
They're out in the hall.

137
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,394
Not that one.
The one that says 7-5.

138
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,049
- I'm in.
- Awesome.

139
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,386
Is that too much?

140
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,553
It's a lot of extra amniotic fluid,
Cheyenne, but your baby looks strong.

141
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,596
Does that mean we can go?
I mean, I appreciate you seeing us,

142
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,566
but this is a long drive for us and
I can't afford to miss another shift.

143
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,330
Unfortunately, Ms. Wood,
the mass on the baby's neck

144
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,429
is what's causing
the build-up of fluid.

145
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,270
It's also obstructing
her airway and the spine.

146
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,004
- Mom?
- It's all right. Let's listen.

147
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,070
We're gonna do a procedure
called an EXIT surgery.

148
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,412
We do a C-Section
and half deliver the baby.

149
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,974
Half deliver?

150
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,317
We pull the head and arms out,
but we don't cut the umbilical cord.

151
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,446
Why?

152
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,957
The tumor won't let air
get to the baby's lungs.

153
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,256
We need the umbilical cord
to keep her alive during the operation.

154
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,160
It's cool, if you think about it.

155
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,461
You'll be your baby's
life support machine.

156
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,525
After the surgery, if all goes well,
we cut the umbilical cord

157
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,436
and you'll be the mother
of a healthy baby girl.

158
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,940
- How's that sound?
- It sounds expensive.

159
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:33,502
Well, your doctor at the clinic
is a former student of mine.

160
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,706
So... it's covered.

161
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,911
I'm going to go ahead
and take this up to the lab.

162
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:46,048
The hospital gets a write-off, and
it makes Dr. Shepherd look good, so...

163
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,787
- So it's not charity?
- It's not charity.

164
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,988
- What time's your shift?
- 6:00 to 6:00.

165
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,554
- Graveyard. In Chehalis?
- Yeah.

166
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,260
That's three hours away.

167
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:59,031
You better get going.
I'll look out for her.

168
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,903
<i> Incoming temp nurses</i>
<i>to conference room three.</i>

169
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,842
- Chief.
- Hello, Meredith.

170
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,918
Saw my mother this morning.

171
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,653
Did you?

172
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,249
How is she?

173
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,384
She's fine.

174
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,259
I'm glad to hear it.

175
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,162
Give her my best.

176
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,767
Why are you...?

177
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,930
It's to mark the borders
of the infection.

178
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,167
We'll watch it.
If it doesn't cross the line,

179
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,006
- you'll get IV antibiotics.
- If it does cross the line?

180
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,980
It'd mean the infection's aggressive.
We'd have to do a muscle biopsy.

181
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,449
- You'd take out a piece of my muscle?
- Mm-hm.

182
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,919
- We're supposed to run a 10K tomorrow.
- Oh, on this leg? I doubt it.

183
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,081
Can you tell us when
you noticed the rash?

184
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,216
When we were
climbing Rainier yesterday.

185
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,226
Wow! You go up
the Emmons Glacier route?

186
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:59,025
Please. You can do that in an SUV.
We did Liberty Ridge.

187
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,929
Oh, wow. That's hardcore.

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,560
Hi, I'm Sydney Heron.
These guys' teacher.

189
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,934
I'm Claire, this is Wade.
It's our honeymoon.

190
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,940
Wow, that's amazing.
God, look at that rock.

191
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:13,638
Did you sustain any trauma on the hike?
Did you fall down or bang your leg?

192
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,375
- No.
- Well, she cut her foot

193
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,849
on oyster shells
at the beach a couple days ago.

194
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,318
- We were windsurfing in Puget Sound.
- Oh, wow.

195
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,049
You need a honeymoon
to recover from your honeymoon.

196
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,318
- Ow.
- Right?

197
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,021
My leg's going to be OK, right?

198
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,529
Yeah. It's probably
a simple skin infection.

199
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,258
Uh, no, it's not. Look.

200
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,097
- Hey.
- Hey.

201
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,800
- Your dog's fine.
- He's your dog now.

202
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,207
I miss him.

203
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,040
He misses you too.

204
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,081
You should come visit.

205
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,412
The dog, I mean.

206
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,145
I'm walking away now.

207
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,248
So I'm looking for a neurosurgeon
to consult on a fetal spinal tumor.

208
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,850
Do you know anybody good?

209
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,790
- Fair hours, fair wages!
- Don't ask George.

210
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,528
- I'm not. He's a doctor.
- Go ahead. Just ask him.

211
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,036
I'm showing support.
They whisper and point.

212
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,799
- George?
- What?

213
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,639
- We need a favor.
- Ava Jenkins in peds, room 4114.

214
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,372
It's time to change her dressing
and it's scary for her

215
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,176
but if you sing the alphabet
or the <i>Wheels on the Bus</i> song

216
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,150
- she can handle it.
- Ms. O'Brien from 2412?

217
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,381
She'll have a panic attack if they don't
check on her once an hour.

218
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,652
- And there's this guy in 2924...
- Hang on. Hang on.

219
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,522
You want me to cross the picket line?

220
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,458
- Yeah.
- Why?

221
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,192
Because they're
our patients too, George.

222
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,893
And we can't.

223
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:46,037
- Anyone care to probe the wound?
- I do.

224
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,300
I'd like to try your
"healing with love".

225
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,367
I like the way you think, Alex.
You do the honors.

226
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,505
Cristina, it looks like someone
needs to learn how to share.

227
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,640
Now slide it in.

228
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,811
- Whoa. No resistance.
- Let me see.

229
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,444
- Dr. Heron?
- Let me see.

230
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,920
Yes?

231
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,150
No healthy muscle
gives way that easily.

232
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,490
My god. Oh, this poor girl. OK everyone,
we're locking down the OR.

233
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,723
All nonessential personnel
must leave now.

234
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,493
- Was that Pathology?
- It's necrotizing fasciitis.

235
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,866
- The flesh-eating bacteria?
- In the flesh.

236
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,434
Oh, good. Somebody's in here.
How's she doing?

237
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,534
- You intubated her?
- Yeah?

238
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,408
- You intubated her.
- I had to.

239
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,812
She was struggling.
Her sats were in the 80's.

240
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,214
She was in a room all alone.
What?

241
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:36,015
A temp nurse found the paperwork
from her chart on the second floor.

242
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,646
- And...
- You put a tube in Grace.

243
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:41,386
- She put a tube in Grace?
- She put a tube in Grace?

244
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,123
Mrs. Bickham was diagnosed
with end stage COPD.

245
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,598
- She's on hospice.
- End of life care?

246
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,965
DNR.
Do not resuscitate.

247
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,429
You schnook!
You were supposed to let her die.

248
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,135
No machines, she said.

249
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,611
She did. I remember.

250
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,444
Her daughter Alice was there
with her girlfriend.

251
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,975
Uh, she's a lesbian.
The daughter. Nice girls.

252
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,817
Stop with the rambling, Agnes.
Make your point.

253
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,551
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,493
Who are you, exactly?
Mrs. Bickham's sisters?

255
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,555
Oh, no. No.
Her sister Rose died in '83.

256
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,602
- May she rest in peace.
- Influenza. Or croup.

257
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:28,072
Only babies die of croup.
Rose died with a cold in her chest.

258
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,233
- Pneumonia.
- Right, pneumonia.

259
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,334
There was her other sister... Harriet.

260
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,810
May she rest in peace.

261
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,176
They cremated her.

262
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,771
Gracie wanted to die.

263
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,646
She made us all promise.

264
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:42,448
This really is something that
I need to speak with her husband about.

265
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,751
Lenny never talked much
when he was alive.

266
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,021
- Good luck getting a word now.
- Lenny's dead?

267
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,994
- May he rest in peace.
- But Grace said she just saw him.

268
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,396
Because she was trying
to cross over!

269
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:58,698
She almost died twice in the last month.
Said she saw him each time.

270
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,705
You ask me,
that's a little meshugena.

271
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:05,039
It's not meshugena!
He was waiting for her in the light.

272
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,409
Mm-hm. Which thanks to you,
she can't reach now.

273
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,780
- I need you to round all those 21 's...
- I'm not here.

274
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,119
- Excuse me?
- I'm here, but I'm not here.

275
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,591
- You won't be anywhere in 30 seconds...
- Sir, all due respect...

276
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,560
No offense intended, uh,

277
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,529
but I won't cross the picket line.

278
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,960
And yet you're standing in front of me.

279
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,298
The nurses want me to check
on their patients,

280
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,338
but then I'm going
right back out there.

281
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,430
- You're a doctor.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,975
But I'm also a union man.

283
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,512
All due respect.
There's no offense intended.

284
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,046
Fine.

285
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,852
Sir? While I have you here,
I'm supposed to tell you that

286
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,389
Mrs. O'Brien in 2412
is allergic to chocolate,

287
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,290
but she pulls the allergy sticker
off her chart.

288
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,759
- Wonderful.
- And that Mr...

289
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,389
...you're supposed to watch Mr. Roberts
in 2119 swallow his diuretics.

290
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,262
Apparently, he likes to hoard them.

291
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,527
Is that it?

292
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,933
Forty to 50 hours
of mandatory overtime is...

293
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,874
Yes, sir! I'm very sorry.
There's no offense intended.

294
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,437
What... wait, flesh-eating...

295
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,378
This is some kind of joke, right?

296
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,178
- She put you up to this?
- No. We have to amputate the leg.

297
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,084
- Cristina.
- We're on our honeymoon.

298
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,054
I'm sorry, Wade.
I know this is scary.

299
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,149
- Amputation is not the only option.
- It's the only sane...

300
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,786
If we don't get this
under control immediately,

301
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,525
- she is going to die.
- But there's another option?

302
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,227
We can try to save the leg
by cutting out the infection.

303
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,463
We might be able
to keep it functional.

304
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,404
- Gold star for Dr. Karev.
- I need to see her.

305
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,634
- No time.
- If we take her out of anesthesia

306
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,678
and put her back under...
You need to make a decision now.

307
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:51,045
I mean, she runs marathons.
This is our adventure honeymoon.

308
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,051
It's... I mean, it's who she is.

309
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,215
OK. Then we'll do everything
we can to save the leg.

310
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,692
You think this is a good idea?

311
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,494
I seriously think
this is a way cooler surgery.

312
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,328
Cheyenne, the prognosis is very good.

313
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,430
We want to go in and get as much
of the tumor out as possible

314
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,667
during your surgery.

315
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,108
- So my baby will be fine?
- Yes.

316
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,271
You may be able to take
her home this week.

317
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,373
- That soon?
- Absolutely. She'll be all yours.

318
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,247
- Oh. OK.
- OK.

319
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,653
If you or your mother have questions,
Dr. Stevens will page me.

320
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,282
See you later.

321
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,663
- Oh, Shakespeare.
- I was reading it to my baby.

322
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:42,030
It's really homework for English.

323
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,035
Was.

324
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,594
The baby wasn't due
for another few more weeks.

325
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,505
- And now I guess...
- No more school.

326
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,770
It's weird.

327
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:56,144
It's like when
you're in school... you hate it.

328
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,775
Until you can't go anymore.

329
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,320
- Have you made any plans?
- Plans?

330
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,586
Bought a crib, called about child care,
looked into assistance?

331
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,285
Not yet.

332
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,989
- You gonna live with your mom?
- I was supposed to be saving money

333
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,556
to get my own trailer home.
But I don't know.

334
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,864
I guess I just thought
I'd have more time.

335
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,204
Nine months goes by fast.

336
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,500
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

337
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,637
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

338
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,389
So, Sydney, have you've seen
a lot of necrotizing fasciitis?

339
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,948
No. Have you?

340
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,962
- If the infection moves she'll die.
- If she wakes up without her leg,

341
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,693
- she might wish she had.
- Right.

342
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,758
She's young, healthy, a newlywed.

343
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,896
And your treatment plan
is based on... cuteness?

344
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,463
If she were an 80-year-old man,
you'd amputate.

345
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,340
She's not 80.
Where's your compassion?

346
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,810
My compassion?

347
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,746
Trying to save a patient from death
is compassionate.

348
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,684
I must say, I'm disappointed in you.
Why can't you be more like Alex?

349
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,282
Excuse me?

350
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,619
This guy, he's compassionate.
He's warm.

351
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,556
He's fighting
to save Claire's leg.

352
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,594
- We're going to win that fight.
- Yes.

353
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,729
Uh, excuse me. Restroom.

354
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,126
Burke.

355
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:28,264
- Hey. I thought you were in surgery.
- I was. Necrotizing fasciitis.

356
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,174
No kidding?
So why are you out here?

357
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,179
Because the new resident,
um, she's the new Bailey...

358
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,738
...except that she's the exact
opposite of Bailey

359
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,546
in absurd, horrifying,
profoundly disturbing ways.

360
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,315
I think the new resident
is killing our patient.

361
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,693
- Dr. Heron, is it?
- It is. And you are?

362
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,064
Preston Burke.

363
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,799
Dr. Burke. Wow, no kidding?
I'm a huge fan.

364
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,637
Thank you.
I, um...

365
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,677
I heard you had necrotizing fasciitis.

366
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,008
So we don't see
a lot of those around here.

367
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,278
Huh. Yeah, well. Being a cardiothoracic
surgeon, I wouldn't think you saw any.

368
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,614
Right. Well, uh...

369
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,421
I was curious what protocol
you were following here?

370
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,258
You were curious
or Cristina was concerned?

371
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,096
I hope you'll forgive the intrusion.
It's nothing personal.

372
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,001
It's just... we haven't
worked with you before.

373
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,935
And Dr. Yang wanted
to be sure that...

374
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,600
Dr. Yang wanted to be sure
the bimbo cheerleader

375
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,939
wasn't trying to kill a patient.
Am I right?

376
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,639
With all due respect,
I know you don't know me well,

377
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,578
but I'm pretty good at what I do.

378
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,209
My patient is a marathoner
and I told her husband

379
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,049
I'm going to try to save her leg.
So my plan...

380
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,180
...is to stand here
for as long as it takes

381
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,816
to scrape away every last cell
of necrotic flesh.

382
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,224
If it's still spreading,
we'll take the leg.

383
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,662
And if we do, then our eager
young intern here can hold the saw.

384
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,996
Now, unlike Dr. Karev, kindness
and compassion aren't very high

385
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,866
on her list of priorities,
but a little bone-saw action,

386
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,738
well, maybe that will earn me
some respect. Am I right?

387
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,572
Now, Dr. Yang,
you ready to scrub back in?

388
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,219
- You're the head of the whole hospital?
- Just the surgeons.

389
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,585
Well, they should make you
the head of everything.

390
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,022
She's batting the lashes.
You see this?

391
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,584
Dr. Webber, the point is,
Grace wants to be with her Lenny.

392
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,220
She misses him terribly.

393
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,664
You realize if I pull out the tube,
Grace will die?

394
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,328
We're old, magpie.
Not daft.

395
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,530
Pull the plug.
It's what she wants.

396
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,473
Ladies, I appreciate
your concern for your friend.

397
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:47,171
But we need to contact a durable
power of attorney to sign the release.

398
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,340
- That's Alice. Call Alice.
- Grace's daughter.

399
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,609
She's a lesbian.

400
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,878
Well, that's OK, isn't it?

401
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,750
I mean, she can still have
the power of attorney.

402
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,791
Uh, fine. But we'll need
Alice's signature.

403
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,452
- Good luck. She lives in Oregon.
- Oh, she can fax it.

404
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,961
I'm sorry.
We'll need her original signature.

405
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,863
Well, can't we just skip that part?

406
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,425
Bat the lashes again.
I think it was working.

407
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,698
Excuse me, ladies.

408
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,698
You're like the Old-Lady Whisperer.

409
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,108
They really cheer up
when you come around.

410
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,772
Meredith, you understand
if the daughter shows up tomorrow

411
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,874
and confirms she is DNR...

412
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,419
I have to kill my patient.
I know.

413
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,679
How you doing?

414
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,554
There something
I can do for you?

415
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,618
Oh, I'm fine, sir. I don't need
any help from you. Thank you.

416
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,023
"Sir, fare you well.

417
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,466
Hereafter, in a better world than this

418
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,835
I shall desire more love
and knowledge of you."

419
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,303
To Dr. O'Malley!

420
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,641
- O'Malley!
- Whoo!

421
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,942
She called me unkind.

422
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,075
Unkind and lacking in compassion.
In front of my boyfriend.

423
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,086
I am not unkind.

424
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,622
I think I have to
kill a woman tomorrow.

425
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,023
I have to take out the tube
that's keeping her alive.

426
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,587
Izzie.

427
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,154
This is the part where you
say what's wrong with you.

428
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,798
- Where're you going?
- I have to...

429
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,634
- I forgot something at work.
- We don't need her.

430
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,340
- I have to kill a woman tomorrow.
- And that's a problem why?

431
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,641
If it's what she wants,
it's what she wants.

432
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,740
And that is not unkind
or lacking in compassion.

433
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,342
I'm a very compassionate person.

434
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:38,083
- I'm more compassionate than Alex.
- Shut your pie hole, Yang.

435
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,624
Hey, Joe? Could we have
another round, please?

436
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,922
Yeah, give Nurse O'Malley
a drink on me.

437
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,288
What'd you say?

438
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,734
- Hey, uh, Karev just called me a nurse.
- At least nurses aren't butchers.

439
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,862
The worst thing you could come up with?
Was that an insult

440
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,032
or is that, uh...
was supposed to be funny?

441
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,336
Whoopsie.

442
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,570
Are you kidding me?

443
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,874
- I will kill you, you know that?
- Bring it on.

444
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,940
Bring..."Oh, bring it on."
OK, mama! Let's bring it on!

445
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:09,077
There's your squad.
Do you want to cheer it out, soccer mom?

446
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,714
- Are you going to throw down bedpans?
- Soccer mom?

447
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,758
Hey, hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Hey!

448
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,588
Hey! If you beat each other up,

449
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,595
there won't be anybody left
to set your broken bones.

450
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,221
- Oh, that would be my job!
- Hey!

451
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,856
...studying my bones.
- Hey!

452
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,631
- We were just leaving.
- Yeah, I've got to go save lives.

453
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,933
Bye!

454
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,566
Excuse me.
They're my ride.

455
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,181
You're awake.

456
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,222
Hey. Yeah. Baby jumps up and down
on my belly all night,

457
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,553
makes me have to pee
all the time.

458
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,285
- You work long hours, huh?
- Yeah.

459
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,021
But I'm off work now. I...

460
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,793
I just came back to talk to you.

461
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,303
- I grew up in Chehalis too.
- Serious?

462
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,830
Serious.
Um, Forest Park.

463
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,643
- The trailer park up behind the church.
- On Route Six.

464
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,875
- My friend Shelley lives up there.
- My mom still lives there.

465
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,439
- No way.
- Yeah.

466
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,628
Can you keep a secret?

467
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,870
This is my daughter.

468
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:46,241
In the picture she's six,
but she's 11 now.

469
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,548
She lived in Santa Barbara,
but... they moved.

470
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,087
I don't know where.

471
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,220
But I know her name is Hannah.

472
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,263
- And she likes pigs.
- Pigs?

473
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,322
Yep. She collects them.

474
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,334
Like figurines and stuffed animals,
you know.

475
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,172
I think it's because
her mom read her <i>Charlotte's Web.</i>

476
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,709
I thought you were her mom.

477
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,908
I'm her mother.

478
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,847
But I'm not her mom.

479
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,846
Look...

480
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,753
I know that where we come from...

481
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,785
this kind of thing
doesn't get talked about.

482
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,355
But I wanted you to know

483
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,956
that there's more than one way
to be a good mother.

484
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:40,768
I wanted... I wanted better for her
than I could do at 16.

485
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,773
I love my baby.

486
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,904
Of course you do.

487
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,443
But you're reading her Shakespeare.

488
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:58,519
When you're working 12-hour shifts
at the diner, like our moms,

489
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,454
you won't be coming home
and reading her Shakespeare.

490
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,804
Oh. I could hear you
from six blocks away.

491
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,007
- Sorry.
- Don't be. I like it.

492
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:28,142
Um, I'm just not sure
how the neighbors would feel.

493
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,711
Which, by the way,
is not a thing

494
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,692
someone lacking in compassion
would be concerned with.

495
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,557
How's your patient's leg?

496
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:41,190
Carved all to hell,
but still on her body.

497
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,632
Oh, we're watching it overnight.

498
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,405
What's going on?

499
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,147
Never in my career have I questioned
a fellow surgeon in their OR.

500
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,914
I never understood
what the problem was,

501
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:08,083
an intern dating an attending,
until today.

502
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,800
Fair hours, fair wages!
Fair hours, fair wages!

503
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:25,033
And don't believe 2519 when she tells
you that she went to the bathroom.

504
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,103
She says she went to the bathroom
and then she's back here two days later.

505
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,011
- Got it.
- I need sutures in 2602.

506
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,811
Can't help you.

507
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,419
What?

508
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,782
Fair hours, fair wages!
Fair hours, fair...

509
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,254
- It's no offense.
- None taken.

510
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,557
Hey, how's the strike going?

511
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,934
Do you know...
do you realize how rarely

512
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,235
doctors say thank you
and please to nurses?

513
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,969
How few surgeons
even know the names of the...?

514
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,239
I shouldn't be seen talking to you.

515
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,381
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Richard Webber?

516
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,611
Can I help you?

517
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,315
My name is Alice Bickham.
I'm here about my mother, Grace.

518
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:17,927
Sure. Um... come with me, please.

519
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:23,424
<i>Any available nurse to admitting.</i>

520
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,992
- You said you would look after her.
- I'm sorry?

521
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:29,165
You told me to go to work
and you said you would look after her.

522
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:35,203
Ms. Woods, um, can you...
just follow me?

523
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,510
Nurses' station.

524
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,140
She's a kid, you know.

525
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,516
She's scared enough without you
putting ideas in her head.

526
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,078
How do you tell a scared kid
to give her baby away?

527
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:48,421
I didn't tell her. I didn't advise her.
I didn't pressure her.

528
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,087
I just... talked to her.

529
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,698
You're not a shrink.

530
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,326
You're not her mother.
She's my kid. And you crossed the line.

531
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,101
- I'm sorry.
- You're not. You're superior.

532
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,505
So what, you're a big shot doctor
and you get to judge us?

533
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,807
You get to tell my kid
how to live her life?

534
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,109
Cheyenne is smart.

535
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:14,117
She's smart and she's thoughtful
and she can have more.

536
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,987
She can have more
than a trailer park

537
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:21,548
and a graveyard shift at a truck stop
diner. Don't you want that for her?

538
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,687
I mean, if you can... get past
the fact that I'm superior

539
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,963
and that I'm judging you and that I'm
telling you what's best for your family.

540
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,697
If you could just get past
all of that,

541
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,236
isn't it possible
that I'm also right?

542
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,647
Pretty spectacular recovery, Claire.

543
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,645
Really? Do you think
it's going to be OK?

544
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,986
We got almost all of
the necrotic tissue.

545
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,288
A few times in a hyperbaric chamber
and you'll be out of the woods.

546
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,421
Thank you for saving my leg.

547
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,666
My pleasure.

548
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,394
Dr. Karev will explain
the hyperbaric chamber. Dr. Karev?

549
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,938
Thank you, Dr. Heron.

550
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,875
- A hyperbaric chamber...
- I'll take that apology any time.

551
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,080
Thank you.

552
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:29,122
So I'm going to give her a sedative,
which will ease her discomfort.

553
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,595
And then I'll remove the tube. OK.

554
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,527
Are you ready?

555
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,133
Yes.

556
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,835
Wait.

557
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,474
Goodbye, Mommy.

558
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,526
Oh. Do you want to...?

559
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,688
Oh, no. No, we've already
said our good-byes.

560
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,824
We just wanted to be here
when Grace crossed over.

561
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,030
Ready.

562
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,512
- I can take care of this.
- I did it. I should undo it.

563
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,262
How long? I mean, before...?

564
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,194
It can take a while.

565
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,861
- She wants me to apologize.
- You crossed the line.

566
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:19,302
- You made me cross the line.
- Oh, like I can make you do anything.

567
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,367
It's not your fault.
It's mine.

568
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,107
I'm your teacher.
I'm supposed to be.

569
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,451
But you came to me as your boyfriend.
And I responded that way.

570
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:45,286
- I'm not used to being wrong.
- I know. But you're an intern.

571
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,329
Second-guessing a resident
is not your job.

572
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,698
How long has it been?

573
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,373
Two hours and 17 minutes.

574
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,918
I saw you there.

575
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,455
At the nursing home
with my mother.

576
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,520
Oh.

577
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,362
They said you go
two or three times a week.

578
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,090
Whenever I can.

579
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,260
Why did you keep it a secret?

580
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,635
I don't know.

581
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,244
Would you like me to stop going?

582
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,016
I'm going to go check on Grace.

583
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,823
Do you think she's Ionely?
My mother?

584
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,955
Yeah, I do.

585
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,103
May she rest in peace.

586
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:55,809
Time of death...
12:42.

587
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,947
I don't... I can't,

588
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,991
I can't, I don't...

589
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,494
I don't... I can't.

590
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,889
I don't want...
I don't want my mother to die alone.

591
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,173
Slow down.
Just slow down.

592
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,109
Shh.

593
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,546
Slow deep breaths now.
Slow deep breaths.

594
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,448
Slow down. Slow down.
Just breathe in the bag.

595
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,058
I'm OK.

596
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,232
You're OK.

597
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,800
Thank you.

598
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,899
You're welcome.

599
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,199
Do you ever wish
you hadn't done it?

600
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,532
No. I really don't.

601
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,308
If I give her up...

602
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:42,045
if I give her away,
do I still get to name her?

603
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,983
You can name her for yourself.

604
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,359
Did you name yours?

605
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,863
Sarah.

606
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,566
That's a pretty name.

607
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,208
Yeah.

608
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,319
I think you should keep visiting her.

609
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:23,951
You sure?

610
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,620
Yeah.

611
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,096
She lights up when you're around.

612
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,667
She's alive.

613
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,634
Oh, she's with Alex.
I can't do this in front of Alex.

614
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:45,677
- Well, you can and you will.
- Excuse me, why aren't you apologizing?

615
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,713
I'm an attending,
I don't apologize to residents.

616
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,381
You, on the other hand,
are an intern.

617
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:57,860
<i>Any available scrub nurse to OR 3.</i>

618
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,858
Sydney, I just wanted to...

619
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,370
...uh, just wanted to, um...

620
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:13,903
...apologize for, you know,
overstepping... I'm sorry.

621
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,572
Well, that's the compassion
I was looking for.

622
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:20,208
Apology accepted.
OK, you want to hug it out?

623
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,117
- Oh.
- Go. Hug.

624
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,451
- Oh. Yeah.
- Come on.

625
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,658
<i>Nurses at Seattle Grace are...</i>

626
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,424
- We need them, Patricia.
- Yes, we need them.

627
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:38,031
So where do I find
the spare change?

628
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,902
It's not like what's hiding underneath
the couch cushions is going to do it.

629
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:46,739
I seem to remember pushing paperwork for
a multi-million dollar surgery robot.

630
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:50,076
There was a waiting list for that.
It will bring in huge business.

631
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:53,913
And could you and the robot handle
that business without nurses?

632
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,078
<i> We can't help ourselves.</i>

633
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:01,181
<i>We see a line,</i>
<i>we want to cross it.</i>

634
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,456
<i>Maybe it's the thrill of trading</i>
<i>the familiar for the unfamiliar.</i>

635
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:10,258
- <i>A sort of personal dare.</i>
- Congratulations.

636
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,895
<i>Only problem is...</i>
<i>once you've crossed</i>

637
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:18,271
<i>it's almost impossible to go back.</i>

638
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,490
You OK?

639
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,322
Yeah. You know, I am.

640
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,430
You OK?

641
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,576
Yeah.

642
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,701
What happened today?

643
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,371
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

644
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,407
OK.

645
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,883
We don't know everything
about each other, George.

646
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,824
Yeah.

647
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,059
True.

648
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:14,689
<i> But, if you do manage</i>
<i>to make it back across that line,</i>

649
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,133
<i>you find safety in numbers.</i>

650
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,367
- Anybody want to have sex?
- George.
