1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,802
<i>Last season on Grey's Anatomy:</i>

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,364
You have to go. I'm late.
Seriously. Goodbye... uh...

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:10,136
- Derek.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,308
A month ago you were in med school
being taught by doctors.

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,715
- Today, you are the doctors.
- You're interns. Grunts.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,151
Nobodies.
Bottom of the surgical food chain.

7
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,486
It's like candy, but with blood,
which is so much better.

8
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:26,787
Dr. Shepherd? He's over there.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,795
Who feels like they have
no idea what they're doing?

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,832
- Stop looking at me like that.
- Like what?

11
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,423
Like you've seen me naked.

12
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,469
I don't get picked
'cause I slept with my boss

13
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,471
and didn't get into med school
'cause I have a famous mother.

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,700
I used to be a doctor, I think.

15
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,938
Fine, George and Izzie,
you can move in.

16
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,309
You blew me off
for a bottle of tequila.

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,473
It's not nearly as much fun
to wake up to.

18
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,178
You mind movin' this tail wagon?

19
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,710
The next time I see you favoring
Meredith Grey in any way,

20
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,020
I'll make sure she doesn't
see the inside of an OR for a month.

21
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,060
- I'm your boss.
- You don't scare me.

22
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:05,655
- Richard promised chief to both of us.
- Keep friends close and enemies closer.

23
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,166
- Morning, Dr. Model.
- Dr. Evil Spawn.

24
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,499
You're not the enemy.
You're just the competition.

25
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,267
What is this that we're doing here?

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,001
You need a definition?

27
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,001
There are other options.

28
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:24,044
It's a tumor.
It's pressing against your optic nerve.

29
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,414
You've got syphilis.

30
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,578
I don't know how this happened.

31
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,916
You and Alex?

32
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,888
You gave me syphilis?

33
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,721
Some people
would call this a relationship.

34
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,021
- Who?
- Me.

35
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,730
My God, you're falling for him.

36
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,198
What makes a hotshot doc
leave the Big Apple?

37
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,128
- Hi. I'm Addison Shepherd.
- Shepherd?

38
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,765
You must be the woman
who's been screwing my husband.

39
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,574
<i> To be a good surgeon,
you have to think like a surgeon.</i>

40
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,615
<i>Emotions are messy.</i>

41
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:00,312
<i>Tuck them neatly away
and step into a clean, sterile room</i>

42
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,820
<i>where the procedure is simple.</i>

43
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,619
<i>Cut, suture and close.</i>

44
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,162
You look familiar. You been here before?

45
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,894
Once. That worked out really well.

46
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,232
I know that look.
It's one of two things.

47
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,795
Either your boss is giving you hell
or your boyfriend is. Which is it?

48
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,102
Both.

49
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:26,475
<i>But sometimes,
you're faced with a cut that won't heal.</i>

50
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:30,243
My boyfriend is my boss,
which was a problem.

51
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:34,582
But not as big a problem as the fact
that my boyfriend has a wife.

52
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,420
Tell you what,
this one, it's on the house.

53
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,551
<i>A cut that rips its stitches wide open.</i>

54
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,155
- What are you doing here?
- Your hair's different.

55
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,826
- A lot of things are different.
- It's longer. It's very Russell Crowe.

56
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:52,167
- What are you doing here?
- You just pick up and leave everything?

57
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:55,674
Your house, your practice, your friends?
You had a life in Manhattan.

58
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,175
Had.

59
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,178
And now you have a girlfriend
in Seattle.

60
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,841
- She seems sweet.
- The ice you're on. Thin.

61
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,680
She's young.

62
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:09,153
That wide-eyed, he's-a-brain-surgeon
thing, but still sweet.

63
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,918
Which was what you were going for.
The anti-Addison?

64
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,186
If you came to try to win me back,
forget it.

65
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,128
I did. I flew across the country
to reminisce over wedding photos,

66
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,964
get drunk, fall into bed, and make you
realize you can't live without me.

67
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,562
Relax. Derek, I'm here for work.

68
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,664
I'm helming the TTTS case
you guys admitted last week

69
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,641
and from Richard's briefing...

70
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,406
- He knew you were coming?
- He asked me. Didn't he say?

71
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,606
- No. He didn't.
- Hm. Surprise.

72
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,979
The hair, though. You know I've
always had a thing for Russell Crowe.

73
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,650
Let me see it.

74
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,722
No lacerations, minimal swelling.

75
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,733
- George really knocked you around.
- He's a lightweight.

76
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,395
- Could've pinned him in a second.
- Why didn't you?

77
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,201
Are you kidding? I'm riding a career
in Plastics all the way to the bank.

78
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,435
Can't afford to injure these babies.

79
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,878
- Especially over O'Malley.
- You had it coming.

80
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,176
The dude punches like my sister.

81
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,548
So, by your definition then
you got beat up by a girl.

82
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,317
All hail the champ!

83
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,825
So my guy Alex finally got
what was coming to him.

84
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,385
- George knocked him down in one punch.
- I don't want to talk about it!

85
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,955
Brag, champ, brag! You've earned it!

86
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,331
Can I have a beer, please?

87
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,997
Let's play a game
of whose life sucks the most.

88
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:36,838
- I'll win. I always win.
- No, you don't want to play with me.

89
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,901
Oh, I do. I'll even go first.

90
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,608
Derek's married.

91
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,417
George, beer is dripping
from your nostrils.

92
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,852
- Told you I'd win.
- No, you don't win.

93
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,021
Did you hear me?
I said Derek is married.

94
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:02,158
As in pigheaded, adulterous,
liar married.

95
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,362
Nothing you could say could top that.

96
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,337
I'm pregnant.

97
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,970
I win.

98
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,237
Joe, you all right?

99
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,744
Hey, Joe!

100
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,438
OK. Maybe Joe wins.

101
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,749
- Lie down.
- The medics are coming.

102
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,318
- You called the gurney patrol?
- Sit back and relax.

103
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:34,162
- The hospital will run some tests...
- Tests? I don't need tests. I'm fine!

104
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,226
You collapsed! On the floor. It's your
bar. You know how filthy this floor is.

105
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,670
- Pulse is strong.
- Minor skull contusions.

106
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,765
- You're sleeping with someone?
- What?

107
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,334
- Even George got some action.
- Correction. George got some syphilis.

108
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,279
- How could I not know?
- Forget this.

109
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,579
The hospital is right across the street.

110
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,313
I can sure as hell
walk across the street by myself.

111
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,823
- I think we should...
- No, I got him. Joe!

112
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,221
All right.

113
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,286
Details. You're pregnant?

114
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,229
What are you gonna do?

115
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,291
Look, you know what happens
to pregnant interns.

116
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,635
I'm not switching to the vagina squad
or spending my life popping zits.

117
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,731
I'm too talented. Surgery's my life.

118
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,641
Which begs the question:
Who are you sleeping with?

119
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,872
- Just a guy.
- That's all I get?

120
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,716
You can't just bring something like this
up and expect me to drop it.

121
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,718
Well, watch me.

122
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,484
Don't you have a date with McDreamy?

123
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,785
- More like McMarried.
- McWhat?

124
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,826
I came to check on Joe.

125
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,828
- You think he's gonna be OK?
- Will he need an operation?

126
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,888
Operation, yes.
OK, hard to tell.

127
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,799
Basilar artery's like a balloon.
Subarachnoid bleeding.

128
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,396
- Aneurysm the size of a golf ball.
- No way to clip something like that.

129
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,669
- Not without magic fingers.
- Or a standstill operation.

130
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,303
You're doing a standstill...
He's doing a standstill operation.

131
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,576
I'd like to try. First I need
some additional patient history,

132
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,482
overnight labs, and a cerebral angio.

133
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,511
- I'm drunk.
- Meredith...

134
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,722
McBastard.

135
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,262
Ahem.

136
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,305
- What are you doing?
- Uh...

137
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,471
I am on her side. But we're talking
a possible standstill here.

138
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,875
Recognize.

139
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,448
- Meredith!
- Go away!

140
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,313
Just wait. We should discuss this.

141
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,047
Here's a thought. No!
Quit following me!

142
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,215
- At least let me explain.
- Explain?

143
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,124
You should have explained
the night we met in the bar.

144
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,889
Before any of the rest of it.

145
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,762
- That would have been a good time.
- Look, I know how you feel.

146
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,960
Do you? Somehow I doubt that.

147
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,526
Because if you did, you would shut up,

148
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,902
and you would turn around
and go back inside,

149
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,841
because you would realize that
I am this close to getting in my car

150
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,208
and running you down in the parking lot!

151
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,813
- Where're your keys?
- I'm fine!

152
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,114
Meredith, give me your keys.

153
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,177
Let's go home.

154
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,053
...and the husband was the...

155
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, I will be back in the morning
to report for duty.

156
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:34,035
And you... get some rest.

157
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,678
What is she doing here?

158
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,281
You and I both know
she's the best in the field.

159
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,657
Bringing Addie out was a business
decision, nothing personal.

160
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,923
Oh, well, what a relief.

161
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,932
It's not personal. It is personal to me.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,560
The workings of my surgical unit
don't have any...

163
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,333
- Don't include my wife!
- Don't include your private life!

164
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,170
Burke will act as chief of surgery
until I'm back on my feet.

165
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,772
You gave chief to Burke.

166
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,148
There's no room for personal
in being chief.

167
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,814
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You have been sleeping with an intern.

168
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,190
So I guess part of being chief
is personal.

169
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,622
Close the door on your way out.

170
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,978
L. S.

171
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,781
<i>IV nurse call ICU, extension 323.</i>

172
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,582
Babcock.

173
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,850
<i>IV nurse call ICU, extension 323.</i>

174
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,892
Right-angle clamp.

175
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,460
Oh. I'm gonna sterilize everything
when I'm done.

176
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,589
The scrub nurses
won't know I was here.

177
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,599
My lips are sealed.

178
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,364
<i>Dr. Tucker to Radiology.
Dr. Tucker to Radiology.</i>

179
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,770
So, I have a question to ask.

180
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,374
I checked the schedule and I noticed
that you and I are both off tonight.

181
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,780
I made reservations.

182
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,841
I have a favorite restaurant.

183
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,213
None of those were questions.

184
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,089
Would you like to go out to dinner
with me tonight?

185
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,671
You know, the OR is the one place
where I can come and think.

186
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,200
I'm thinking right now, OK?

187
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,336
Of course.

188
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,983
I get it.

189
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,985
I'm not a violent person.
I'm a pacifist.

190
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,893
But, you know,
he just kept pushing and push...

191
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,158
He pushed me, I pushed back.

192
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,530
I was pushed. And now he...

193
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:12,332
If Alex tries to lay a hand on you,
just tell me, I'll take care of it.

194
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,168
You...

195
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,038
I don't need you to take care of it.

196
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,078
If Alex starts something
I'll handle it myself.

197
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,977
I can handle it.

198
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,039
OK, people, assignments.

199
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,347
Yang, you're on discharges.
O'Malley report to room E19.

200
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,447
Grey come see me,
and who was on call last night?

201
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,821
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

202
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,055
Redo these and return them to me
before lunch, understood?

203
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,824
- Understood.
- Karev, don't tempt me.

204
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,298
- Somebody's popular.
- Meaning?

205
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,858
There's been a special request,
just for you.

206
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,029
The chief runs through all of this?

207
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:50,633
Before lunch. After, you've got calls
to return, a budget to approve,

208
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,443
two staff meetings, and four of
Richard's surgeries, including your own.

209
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,141
Absolutely. No problem.

210
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,808
Virgins.

211
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,875
So. Congratulations are in order.

212
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,649
Don't sweat it,
I'll only be your boss for a few days.

213
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,159
I'm aware of Richard's recovery time.
I operated on him, remember?

214
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,060
I do. He survived and chose me
to take over while recruiting your wife.

215
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,791
Clearly, he has brain damage.

216
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,333
Or is it your ex-wife?
I'm a little fuzzy on that.

217
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,996
- We're separated.
- Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Burke.

218
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,403
- You're never interrupting.
- She always is.

219
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,466
I was checking to see if Dr. Burke
secured the intern...

220
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,341
The intern you requested? He did.

221
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,859
Define TTTS.

222
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,988
Twin-twin transfusion syndrome.
Conjoined fetal twins.

223
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,622
Connected by?

224
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,964
- Blood vessels in the placenta.
- Meaning?

225
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,837
One twin gets too much blood,
the other too little, endangering both.

226
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,704
I'd expect you to know that, Grey.

227
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,074
You said probably nothing could be done.

228
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,204
TTTS is usually impossible to correct.

229
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,010
Unless you are one of a handful
of surgeons in the world

230
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,608
who knows how to separate
fetal blood vessels.

231
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,915
Which, luckily for you, I am.

232
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,081
So we'll get you into surgery tomorrow.

233
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,422
If you have any questions at all,
please ask Dr. Grey.

234
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:20,159
From what I have seen, she is one of
the hospital's most popular interns.

235
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,792
I could've answered your question
given a chance.

236
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:26,827
Chin up. I'm this tough on everyone, not
just the women my husband sleeps with.

237
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,342
Order an ultrasound for her
and pre-op labs in...

238
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,845
Hi. Can I have the chart
for E19, please? Thank you.

239
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,549
Oh, good, you're here.
Let's get started.

240
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,919
OK.

241
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,759
- O'Malley.
- Yeah?

242
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,320
- You're touching me.
- Yeah.

243
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,196
No. Carmen...

244
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,301
I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

245
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:05,673
As long as I'm in here, I don't know
what's happening out there.

246
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,975
With my doctors.
My patients. My hospital.

247
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,279
You are my eyes today. My ears.

248
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,081
- I want you to be a sponge.
- A sponge?

249
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,954
You report any and everything
happening in this hospital to me.

250
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,050
- I'm an investigative sponge.
- I'm not fooling around.

251
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,654
There's too much been happening lately
under my radar.

252
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,131
It stops today.

253
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,673
<i>IV nurse, call ICU extension 3231.</i>

254
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,408
<i>IV nurse, call ICU extension 3231.</i>

255
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,511
Burke. You gave Grey to Addison.
Are you sure about that?

256
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:52,079
That's not your call, Shepherd.
And for the record, I'm always sure.

257
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,455
Did you need me?
As the new chief, I'm...

258
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,053
- Interim chief.
- "Chief" nonetheless.

259
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,928
Ever attempt a standstill surgery?

260
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,427
It's the location of
the aneurysm that makes it tricky.

261
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,496
Your body temperature would be lowered
to protect it and stop the heart.

262
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,066
Which stops blood flow to the brain
which reduces the risk of rupture.

263
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,442
I'll have 45 minutes
to clip the aneurysm.

264
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,914
- Before I get the heart started again.
- You wanna freeze my body,

265
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,781
- drain my blood, and stop my heart?
- And bring you back.

266
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,718
- In under 45 minutes?
- Right.

267
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,416
- If you go over, is it free?
- No.

268
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,858
Dr. Yang, you can go and handle
the pre-op labs now.

269
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,598
How much?
How much does something like this cost?

270
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,794
Don't worry about that right now.

271
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,896
Look, you guys say that you can kill me
and bring me back, I believe you.

272
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,100
You're doctors, but I own a bar.

273
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,804
I don't got any insurance so I'm not
that concerned about the surgery

274
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,439
so much as what I'm gonna do
when I survive it.

275
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,110
I need a number. Ten grand? Twenty?

276
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,782
- Thirty?
- It's a couple hundred at least.

277
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,881
At least.

278
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,587
Who's Halloran?

279
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,564
Patient in 4115.

280
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,897
<i>-  Dr. Cole, call the OR.
- Red hair?</i>

281
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,494
Wife knits all the time?
He had the colectomy?

282
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,597
Ah, colon dude. That's right.
Who's Monterroso?

283
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,199
4238. Mom with the really cute kids.

284
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,178
She spiked a post-op fever.
You spent two hours with her.

285
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,804
Hernia chick. That's right.

286
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,009
You've treated them for a week
and you don't know their names?

287
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,316
In Surgery we don't waste time
getting to know the patients.

288
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,913
- They're meat, we're butchers.
- They're humans.

289
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,959
You do know what a human is,
Evil Spawn?

290
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,154
I'm not evil.
Unless evil turns you on.

291
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:42,758
Do you ever wake up, realize nobody
likes you, and, I don't know, care?

292
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,464
Oh.
I think somebody likes me.

293
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,210
Hey.

294
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,770
What, you don't speak
now you're chief? Burke!

295
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,784
- What do you want?
- What?

296
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,412
What do you want?
You don't want to go out to dinner.

297
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:06,356
You don't want to meet me in the on-call
room, and you don't want to talk to me.

298
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,622
I could pretend I know, but I don't
have your home phone number.

299
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,960
- So tell me, what do you want?
- Don't yell at me.

300
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,057
- We're having a conversation.
- What do you want?

301
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,536
I don't know!

302
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,701
Figure it out.

303
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,796
What's the report?

304
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,892
No report. It's very quiet today, sir.

305
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,665
There's no gossip?
Surgeries I should know about?

306
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,869
- Now come on, what's the buzz?
- You know, not in halls, not in OR.

307
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,706
Not in the stairwells.

308
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:04,943
Especially nothing happening in the,
you know... They're just stairwells.

309
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,684
They told me you were in a nightgown,
but I thought I'd come see.

310
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,853
Very nice, huh.

311
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,262
Heard O'Malley laid you out cold.
Nice eye.

312
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,961
- Whoa, who sent that?
- We all pitched in. The whole floor.

313
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,800
Well, please,
tell the whole floor a big thank you.

314
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,203
Yeah, I will.

315
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,972
Alex, you gotta get me out of here, man.
Get me transferred to County Hospital.

316
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,980
Not County. Here, they can kill you
and bring you back,

317
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,380
but at County,
they can just kill you. No joke.

318
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,476
I can't afford this place, man.
I'm gonna lose the bar.

319
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,783
- Hey, Joe, how you doing?
- Hey, Scooter.

320
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,087
OK. That's mine?

321
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,562
- We'll start by saving your life.
- The bar is my life. You know that.

322
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,497
You've been at last call
every night since you moved here.

323
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,093
I'm gonna have to shut it down
or sell it.

324
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,730
You can't do that.
Place is an institution.

325
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,297
I've owned the bar across the street
for 14 years,

326
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,935
and I've never been
inside this hospital till now.

327
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,503
I'll pay my tab. That's gotta be
good for something. How much is it?

328
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,446
Close to a grand.

329
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,487
How about I pay, like, 60?

330
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,653
That's good.
And I'll pay you back later.

331
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,158
Hey, champ!

332
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:27,389
<i> Orderly, please report to station
three. Orderly, report to station three.</i>

333
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,302
What does it take
to go after another woman's husband?

334
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,465
- Excuse me?
- It happened to me.

335
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,068
Jeff moved in with a long-legged
miniskirt who answers his phones

336
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,977
three weeks into my pregnancy.
That gel is really cold.

337
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,675
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about your husband.

338
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,685
Are you sorry about
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd's husband?

339
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,323
I'm going to be checking
a few things today.

340
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,350
I bet she asked to work with you.
It's what I would have done.

341
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,692
I'm gonna go check on your labs.

342
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,945
Heya, sunshine.

343
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,351
Deep breath.

344
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,856
Morning sickness must suck.

345
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,655
Just so we're clear,

346
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,665
do not breathe a word of what you heard
last night to anyone.

347
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,726
Not about me. Not about Meredith. Not
about Meredith and Dr. McDreamy...

348
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,829
- Hey, Dr. Burke.
- Joe.

349
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:47,742
Um, vital signs stable overnight.
Today's CT shows no re-bleeding.

350
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,678
The EKG...

351
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,774
shows...

352
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,684
um, normal sinus rhythm.

353
00:20:55,754 --> 00:21:00,453
No ischemia, no dysrhythmias.

354
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,657
Looking good.
Page me if there are any changes.

355
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,191
Oh, hi, Chief.

356
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,066
No, not much going on.

357
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:16,437
Other than your interim chief making out
with my friend in the stairwell,

358
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,976
but, hey... Sponge duty sucks.

359
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,877
- You talking to yourself now?
- Yes. No!

360
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,673
Damn it, I'm a bad sponge.
A leaky sponge.

361
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,777
I'm gonna leak all the wrong secrets.

362
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,790
I'm a bad liar,
can't even lie about talking to myself.

363
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,690
You look nice today.

364
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,657
Wore my new lip gloss

365
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:43,531
'cause my ex-boyfriend's wife looks like
Isabella freakin' Rossellini,

366
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,696
and I'm like... me.

367
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:53,100
I'm trying to outdo her when she's
the victim here. How crazy is that?

368
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,078
Not crazy. Smart.

369
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,811
You know, gloss, you know,
prevents chapped lips and... you...

370
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,183
Ex-boyfriend?

371
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,313
I'm an evil mistress.

372
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,790
Well, still. You look nice.

373
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,260
Thanks. What are you doing here?

374
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,424
Come on, O'Malley. Out with it.

375
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,494
OK. Can you think of any reason,
any reason at all, really,

376
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,631
why Cristina would be kissing Burke?

377
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:42,818
After all this time. All your warnings
about me sleeping with my boss,

378
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,590
- and you're doing the same thing?
- It's not the same.

379
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,633
- It's the same...
- You two are in a relationship.

380
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,361
And you and Burke are in?

381
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:54,098
Switzerland. It's very neutral there.
And they make very nice watches.

382
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,335
Have you even bothered to tell Burke
about the baby?

383
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,470
- Are you going to?
- Look, Meredith, can we not go there?

384
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,743
Can everyone just accept that
I like to keep some things to myself?

385
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:08,547
- I don't discuss everything to death.
- Well, why even confide in me at all

386
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,088
if you're so intent
on not discussing it?

387
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,283
Why even tell me?

388
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,931
When I found out about the miniskirt,
I called her up and took her to lunch.

389
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,303
It was perfectly civil.
I said I didn't hold it against her,

390
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,036
that these things happened. But, really?

391
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,771
I wanted to put a face on the bitch

392
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,678
that got my husband to throw away
15 years of marriage.

393
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,753
- Got a second?
- Depends on what you need.

394
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,299
Who the hell is Dr. McDreamy?

395
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,829
Me. I'm Dr. McDreamy.

396
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,069
I'm tall, handsome.

397
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:09,102
I lean against things and ponder the
difficulties of dating beautiful women.

398
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,479
I'm trying to be a surgeon here!

399
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,418
- That took a lot of nerve.
- She came highly recommended.

400
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,284
- Right.
- So you don't recommend her?

401
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,721
- I did not say that.
- Just not her medical skills.

402
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,190
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Yes?

403
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,422
Labs confirm what look like
abnormalities on the ultrasound.

404
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:28,432
- I think you should come and see.
- Fine. Let's go.

405
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,991
- Meredith. Meredith...
- Don't.

406
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:38,943
<i> Any available IV nurse to OR Two.
Any available IV nurse to OR Two.</i>

407
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,740
Well, no report.

408
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,614
You know, same nothing as earlier.

409
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,415
I should go.

410
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,479
Oh, actually there is something, sir.

411
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:55,151
- Burke and Shepherd marking territory?
- No, sir.

412
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,718
It's about Joe. The bartender.

413
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,696
The standstill patient.

414
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:05,292
See. Bilateral pleural effusion
with evidence of subQ edema.

415
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,366
In English, please?

416
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,967
We've detected what looks like
beginning heart failure in the twins.

417
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,603
- Don't be alarmed.
- Are my babies gonna be OK?

418
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,137
I'm going to take you into surgery now.
Book the OR.

419
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,683
Move.

420
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:24,544
Tell Pete to wash out the taps
every night. Not every other night.

421
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:29,253
And remind him that the delivery truck
comes at 6:00a. m. Kegs go in the back.

422
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:33,991
Oh, another thing. There's petty cash
on the top shelf in the storage closet.

423
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,960
We're operating on patients. That's it.

424
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,061
- I know, but...
- I sympathize. I do.

425
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,232
But solving Joe's finances
is not my job, it's not your job,

426
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,368
and it's sure as hell not the job
I assigned you today.

427
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,403
It seems wrong to cut him open, sew him
up, and leave him, left with nothing.

428
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,883
If we can save his life, we'll hardly
be leaving him with nothing.

429
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,825
That's as far as I can go for now.
Let's start cooling him.

430
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,604
Can't see much from back here, O'Malley.

431
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,810
I know. I'm trying to find a loophole
to help Joe.

432
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,611
- You know Joe?
- Oh, yeah.

433
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,055
I was the only female intern my year.

434
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,389
I didn't know anybody
and nobody knew me except Joe.

435
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,723
He knew me.

436
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,430
Oh. So, you and Joe?

437
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,625
All you people ever think about
is how to get into somebody's pants.

438
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,229
You're nasty.
That's why you got syphilis.

439
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,298
Joe was the first person here
to say I'd make a good surgeon.

440
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:56,370
Not that he knew anything about it.
But it was somethin' when I had nothin'.

441
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:02,218
Oh, sure. I'm the guy with the heart
of stone and you brought snacks.

442
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,778
- It's a working lunch.
- Snacks to watch Joe die.

443
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,222
He's not gonna "die" die.
They'll bring him back.

444
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,523
He is going to "die" die.
No "pulse" pulse. He'll be "dead" dead.

445
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,426
It's a granola bar, Alex.

446
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,625
Not a bag of supersize popcorn
and a box of chocolate movie mints.

447
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,565
That's it.

448
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:19,592
Dead!

449
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,531
Excuse me.

450
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:26,706
Julie, we're gonna go in
laparoscopically.

451
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,804
You're not gonna feel anything.
And neither are the twins.

452
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,781
OK, let's get going!

453
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:37,179
Ten blade.
Begin with a three-millimeter incision.

454
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,397
- We stop the blood flow?
- To protect the brain.

455
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,594
Operate in a bloodless field
so the aneurysm won't rupture.

456
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,298
- And cool the body?
- To induce hypothermia.

457
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,966
Keeps the tissue viable
until the blood is restored.

458
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,543
Body temp is at 60 degrees.

459
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,545
OK, Joe. Time to die.

460
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,888
Flatline.

461
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,957
- We've got 45 minutes, people.
- Start the clock.

462
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,059
Got it.

463
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,216
So what's your "Joe" story?
Seems like everybody here has one.

464
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,050
You first.

465
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:47,853
OK. I went to Joe's place
the night before I started working here.

466
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,087
I'd only been in town,
you know, a few days.

467
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,857
I met a woman. I got drunk
and she took advantage of me.

468
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,195
Or she got drunk
and I took advantage of her.

469
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:58,292
I got drunk and she took...
No. We were drunk. Definitely.

470
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:02,567
Somebody took advantage. Either way, I
look at it as my initiation to Seattle.

471
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,666
- What about you?
- Oh, I don't have one.

472
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,803
I just wanted to hear yours.

473
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,185
So, technically, the paperwork
just needs to be submitted

474
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,248
by midnight of the day of the surgery
to be considered?

475
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,591
Oh, good.
Well, thank you very much. Thanks.

476
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,031
How you doing there, Grey?

477
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,729
Good. I'm good.

478
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,078
You know, I'm very sweet
once you get to know me.

479
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,341
- No, you're not.
- We could be good friends.

480
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,872
- Alex. Never, ever. Ever.
- Why not?

481
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:51,445
Give me one reason why we could?
What about you is even remotely human?

482
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,789
It's going too slowly.

483
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:59,125
- I hope Joe can pull through this.
- He can. He will. He has to.

484
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,832
<i> Damn it.
I can't get the clamp to hold.</i>

485
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:07,998
Give me the bipolars.
I'm gonna go in at a different angle.

486
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,233
Time remaining?

487
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,572
- Irrigation, please.
- 17 minutes.

488
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,738
Shepherd, I need eight minutes
to get him back, to warm him up.

489
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,339
Time to make
the next 17 minutes count.

490
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,146
Right there, go in from there. See it?

491
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,551
See, that's why we can't
do it right there.

492
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,089
He's dead. Technically.

493
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,992
Which is science,
and this is a huge thing.

494
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,860
So some research foundation
has to be interested.

495
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,026
So, in essence, you want to donate
Joe's body to science?

496
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,262
At least for the next 17 minutes.

497
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,272
- "Privately funded grant."
- For educational purposes.

498
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,673
We're a teaching hospital.
The standstill surgery qualifies.

499
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,712
I didn't peg you for the type
to ignore my instructions.

500
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,011
All due respect, sir, it's worth a shot.
It's someone's life.

501
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,551
It's always someone's life, O'Malley.

502
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,788
You're hovering.

503
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,887
- You can leave now.
- OK.

504
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,161
Eight minutes.

505
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,571
We need to start rewarming, Shepherd.

506
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,506
Take the bipolars, please. Thank you.

507
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,908
Shepherd,
we need to start warming him up, now!

508
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,539
- Hang on.
- Now. I need it now, Shepherd.

509
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:27,073
I can't seem to get...
I just can't get behind the aneurysm.

510
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:30,143
If I could get behind the aneurysm,
I could... There it is.

511
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,057
Got it. That's it.

512
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,184
- Are you sure?
- I'm always sure.

513
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:40,024
Good work, everybody.
It's all yours there, Chief.

514
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,866
OK, let's grab Joe
before he decides to go into the light.

515
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,994
Start warming him up.

516
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,004
Clamps are coming off.

517
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,370
Turn the pump on.

518
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,271
Watch cerebral perfusion pressures.

519
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,781
Keep M. A. P. at greater than 60, please.

520
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,918
I know
you're enjoying yourself, Preston.

521
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,926
It's a power kick to be the chief.

522
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,361
You're never more surrounded.
Never more alone.

523
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,197
You're everyone's father,
everyone's boss, and no one's friend.

524
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,897
Choices you make.
Clean slices and neat stitches.

525
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:23,770
No emotions, no compromise,
no personal life.

526
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,969
- But, Richard...
- I just had brain surgery.

527
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:31,448
I'm surrounded by fruit baskets.

528
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:35,213
The only people who've been in this room
come and kiss my ass.

529
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,955
I gave you a shot for a reason, Preston.

530
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:43,790
You and I, we're the same.

531
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,397
We put the job first.

532
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,468
That was the single most amazing surgery
I have ever witnessed.

533
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,913
You, you killed a man
and brought him back to life.

534
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,678
You, like, raised the dead.

535
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,242
God, how does that feel?
Are you rushing? Is it...

536
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,618
Like you wouldn't believe.

537
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:15,819
Hey, do you still have those
reservations? 'Cause I'm starving.

538
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,454
Cristina, I think there's something
we should discuss.

539
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,859
Yeah. Yeah, there is.

540
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,297
It's pretty clear.

541
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,468
It is?

542
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:35,011
We've been fooling ourselves

543
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,980
to think that we can continue
without consequences.

544
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,744
Consequences...

545
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,047
We have careers to think about.

546
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,519
Reputations.

547
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,647
We both put the job first.

548
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,817
You are very focused. I respect that.

549
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,662
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

550
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,220
<i> Any available IV nurse to OR two.</i>

551
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,658
Oh, you're ending this?

552
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,768
I think it's best to make a clean break.

553
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,033
OK.

554
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,475
Before it gets too involved.
Before it gets...

555
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,036
Messy. Right, right. That would be bad.

556
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,510
It's nothing personal.

557
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,552
Get in here, O'Malley.

558
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,362
OK. I tried. I really tried.

559
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,268
But there's a lot of stuff happening
out there. Stuff I can't tell you.

560
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,363
Stuff I won't tell you.

561
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,603
Crazy stuff.

562
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,873
Stuff I'm gonna have nightmares about.

563
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,712
But I'm not gonna tell you
about any of it.

564
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,581
Because it doesn't matter.

565
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,120
Not when there's a guy
who we all know and love

566
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,624
who's gonna be bankrupt because
he needed a surgery to save his life.

567
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,751
- I spent the whole day on it.
- O'Malley...

568
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,988
Let me finish.

569
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,721
You're wrong, sir.

570
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:39,031
Now you can fire me, or bring me up
on disciplinary action or whatever.

571
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,094
I'm telling you, Joe deserves...

572
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:45,575
Deserves our help.
Couldn't help yourself, could you?

573
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:50,012
Whether or not it'd win you any points,
even from me.

574
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,912
I signed your request.

575
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,178
Give it to Patricia,
she'll know what to do.

576
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,312
- Joe may keep his bar after all.
- Thank you, sir.

577
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,412
- O'Malley!
- Yes?

578
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,390
Yell at me again,
and I'll snap you like a twig.

579
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,984
Yes, sir.

580
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,958
See? Just a small scar.

581
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,400
And my babies?

582
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,028
<i> Dr. Cole, call the OR.</i>

583
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,335
Your babies are doing very well.

584
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,874
And Dr. Grey will be back
to check on you a little bit later.

585
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,881
I'd prefer it if Dr. Grey
were taken off the case.

586
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,849
Why, is there a problem?

587
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,718
Just reminds me of someone I don't like.
Someone my husband likes a lot.

588
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,780
Particularly in lingerie.
You understand.

589
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,520
No, no, I don't understand.

590
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,119
Well, she's sleeping
with your husband, right?

591
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:46,834
Ms. Philips,
I lack Dr. Grey's class and patience

592
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,838
so, let me set the record straight.

593
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,306
My husband didn't cheat on me,
I cheated on him.

594
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,037
So the wronged woman here, Dr. Grey.

595
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:58,241
So, I think you owe her
one hell of an apology.

596
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,682
One night I parked my car,

597
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:15,231
I unlock my front door, go inside
my house, and something's different.

598
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,933
Nothing's different,
everything's the same

599
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:23,406
but yet, still, something's different.

600
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:28,373
And I stand there for a while.

601
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,245
And then I know.

602
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:38,914
See, there are moments for me, you know,
usually when I'm in the OR,

603
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,054
when I just know
what's gonna happen next.

604
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,467
So I go upstairs.

605
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:55,266
As I walk down the hall, I try
to prepare myself for what I'm gonna see

606
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,897
when I go into my bedroom.

607
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,534
I step on a man's jacket
that doesn't belong to me.

608
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:06,040
And everything
I think I know... just shifts.

609
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:12,187
Because the jacket that doesn't belong
to me is a jacket that I recognize.

610
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:15,657
And what I know now is
that when I go into my bedroom,

611
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,490
I'm not just gonna see
that my wife is cheating on me.

612
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,429
I'm gonna see that my wife
is cheating on me with Mark,

613
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,729
who happened to be my best friend.

614
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:30,863
It's just so pedestrian,
common and dirty,

615
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,966
and cruel.

616
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,639
Mostly just cruel.

617
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,408
I left. Came out here.

618
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,477
- And you met me.
- And I met you.

619
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,028
Well, what was I to you?

620
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,696
The girl you screwed
to get over being screwed?

621
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,507
You were like coming up for fresh air.

622
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,609
It's like I was drowning
and you saved me.

623
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,844
That's all I know.

624
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,684
It's not enough.

625
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,431
<i>They say practice makes perfect.</i>

626
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:46,382
<i>Theory is,
the more you think like a surgeon</i>

627
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,445
<i>the more you become one.</i>

628
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,324
<i>The better you get
at remaining neutral, clinical.</i>

629
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,591
<i>Cut, suture, close.</i>

630
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,268
<i>And the harder
it becomes to turn it off...</i>

631
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,436
Thought I might see
your ugly mug in here tonight.

632
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,710
Did you hear the good news?

633
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,217
<i>... to stop thinking like a surgeon.</i>

634
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,014
O'Malley!

635
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,867
I heard what you did, champ.

636
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:44,966
<i> And remember what it means
to think like a human being.</i>

637
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,766
The clinic has a policy.

638
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,167
They wouldn't let me
confirm my appointment

639
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:16,468
unless I designated
an emergency contact person.

640
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,270
Someone to be there, just in case,

641
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:23,746
and to help me home, you know, after.

642
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,215
Anyway, I put your name down.

643
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,791
That's why I told you I'm pregnant.
You're my "person."

644
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,193
I am?

645
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,424
Yeah, you are.

646
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:46,699
Whatever.

647
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,398
He dumped me.

648
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,689
You realize this constitutes hugging?

649
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,952
Shut up.

650
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,017
I'm your "person."

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
