{29}{48}i'm george.

{240}{269}who's thatch?
{269}{297}my dad.
{297}{331}thatcher.
{331}{364}she never talks about him.

{403}{446}oh, so she moved in with you.
{446}{475}didn't she tell you?
{475}{525}and what i know now is that|when i go into my bedroom,
{525}{551}i'm gonna see that my wife
{551}{597}is cheating on me with mark
{597}{647}who happened to be my best friend.
{755}{796}after careful consideration
{796}{844}and many sleepless nights
{844}{892}(here's what i've decided)
{923}{990}there's no such thing as a grown-up.
{1268}{1319}we move on. we move out
{1319}{1376}we move away from our families
{1376}{1427}and form our own
{1446}{1465}oh, no
{2163}{2211}hello?
{2211}{2237}no. dr. burke.
{2306}{2328}yes.
{2431}{2465}yes, i'll let her know.
{2585}{2637}that was your landlord.
{2637}{2661}he wants you to know
{2661}{2714}that there's a minor flood|in your apartment.
{2745}{2774}your other apartment.
{2822}{2863}but the basic insecurities
{2863}{2908}the basic fears
{2918}{2992}and all those old wounds|just grow up with us
{2992}{3026}i'm exhausted.
{3045}{3064}me, too.
{3064}{3141}and just when we think|that life and circumstance
{3141}{3174}(have forced us to truly)
{3174}{3230}once and for all become an adult...
{3230}{3287}i was going at it all night|in the on call room.
{3287}{3318}what's your excuse?
{3318}{3405}your mother says something like that
{3405}{3426}mom.
{3426}{3508}i tell you, that man |makes me purr like a kitten.
{3508}{3532}mom.
{3532}{3592}when he isn't making me|growl like a tiger.
{3592}{3654}stop.
{3654}{3680}and my husband wonders
{3680}{3723}why i'm not interested|in him anymore.
{3723}{3771}or worse,something like that
{3771}{3843}if he had any balls at all,
{3843}{3884}he would leave on his own.
{3903}{3956}no. he plays stupid.
{3966}{4016}he's waiting for me to kick him out.
{4016}{4052}i come home with a hickey|on my shoulder
{4052}{4086}a hickey, for god's sake
{4086}{4136}like i'm some sex-crazed teenager,
{4136}{4193}which, let's face it,these days, i am,
{4220}{4268}and what does thatcher do?
{4268}{4316}pretends he doesn't see it.
{4347}{4395}we get bigger|we get taller
{4395}{4433}we get older
{4433}{4479}but... for the most part
{4479}{4519}we're still a bunch of kids
{4519}{4611}running around the playground|trying desperately to fit in
{4611}{4637}you know, he's acting like
{4637}{4671}i committed a crime,
{4671}{4738}like my apartment is full of stolen goods.
{4738}{4786}he's acting like i kept my apartment
{4786}{4814}to hide stolen goods
{4814}{4862}so i could do|illegal transplants for money.
{4862}{4905}are you sure he's not|just acting like you lied
{4905}{4925}about moving in?
{4963}{4994}okay,what's wrong with you?
{5025}{5071}my mommy's a filthy whore.
{5234}{5256}you have dirty in your eyes.
{5270}{5301}you have dirty in your eyes.
{5320}{5366}i'm not doing dirty with you anymore.
{5366}{5402}it was a one-time lapse in judgment.
{5402}{5459}well, it was a 4-time lapse in judgment.
{5507}{5546}well, it's not gonna happen again.
{5546}{5570}oh. okay.
{5582}{5622}i'm serious.
{5622}{5668}we're friends,and it didn't work
{5668}{5701}when we tried to be more than that.
{5701}{5742}so...
{5742}{5773}as fun as it was,
{5773}{5812}it's not gonna happen again.
{5838}{5862}stop looking at me.
{5862}{5889}i'm not looking at you,
{5889}{5903}i'm rounding.

{6490}{6562}he explained that i have a 25% chance
{6562}{6603}of surviving the, uh, surgery.
{6613}{6665}well, unfortunately,that's about right.
{6680}{6723}if you should elect not to proceed,
{6737}{6790}we can make you more comfortable.
{6843}{6915}with all due respect, uh...
{6915}{6934}there's no way
{6934}{7003}that you can make a man|dying a slow death comfortable.

{7114}{7129}how do i look today?
{7130}{7166}would you say, you know,|i look nice?

{8631}{8679}you know, if you pretend|i'm a lion, it helps.
{8679}{8706}sorry?
{8706}{8727}if you pretend i'm a lion
{8727}{8770}instead of a really messed up kid,
{8770}{8823}you get a talking circus animal,
{8823}{8878}which is way easier to look at.
{8890}{8926}dr. yang, what's our|immediate concern?
{8926}{8953}uh, that the bony tumors
{8953}{8977}are growing inward
{8977}{9010}and encroaching on his brain.
{9221}{9310}"invasive non-small cell|with a history of c.o.p.d."?
{9348}{9389}guy's pretty much a goner, huh?
{9403}{9475}sensitivity...i like that in a stranger.
{9494}{9518}are you new here?
{9518}{9542}visiting.
{9542}{9571}confounded by all the rain,
{9571}{9622}and it's only|my first day in town.
{9641}{9667}you get used to it.
{9667}{9715}makes me want|to stay in bed all day.
{9785}{9842}we just met, and already|you're talking about bed.
{9842}{9866}not very subtle.
{9866}{9914}subtle's never been my strong suit.
{9938}{9955}so...
{9998}{10034}do you ever go out with co-workers?:
{10142}{10195}i, um, make it a rule not to.
{10216}{10286}then i am so glad that i don't work here.
{10322}{10355}are you hitting on me
{10377}{10403}in a hospital?
{10403}{10434}would that be wrong?
{10487}{10501}meredith.
{10540}{10573}ow. ah.
{10614}{10645}what the hell was that?
{10693}{10729}that was mark.
{10902}{10947}punching out people|on my surgical floor?
{10947}{10991}my head of neurosurgery
{10991}{11046}punching out people|on my surgical floor?
{11055}{11077}put the ice back on your hand, derek.
{11077}{11113}my hand is fine.
{11113}{11173}put the damn ice on|your $2-million-a-year hand.
{11173}{11233}now... would someone tell me
{11233}{11276}what the hell happened?
{11369}{11393}that was mark.
{11393}{11432}who's mark?
{11456}{11496}he and derek used to work together
{11496}{11532}back in new york.
{11633}{11667}and, uh...
{11688}{11767}they were...we were all close friends
{11811}{11832}until...
{11863}{11933}derek found us in bed together.
{12026}{12058}you put your weight behind it?
{12058}{12074}yes, sir.
{12132}{12153}well, all right, then.
{12333}{12360}what the hell is he doing here?
{12360}{12384}i have no idea.
{12444}{12503}derek and i always did have|the same taste in women.
{12515}{12544}excuse me?
{12559}{12602}you're derek's lusty intern, right?
{12616}{12683}i heard about you|all the way back in new york.
{12683}{12743}you're famous.
{12743}{12767}well...
{12774}{12832}i heard about you|all the way here in seattle,
{12832}{12887}so i guess we have a lot in common.
{12904}{12940}we're the dirty mistresses.
{12971}{13009}i suppose we are.
{13019}{13093}my $400-an-hour shrink|says that
{13093}{13170}it's because behind this rugged|and confident exterior
{13170}{13225}i'm self-destructive and self-loathing
{13225}{13283}to an almost pathological degree.
{13283}{13338}hey, we do have a lot in common.
{13338}{13386}you know, it's funny.
{13386}{13410}der...
{13434}{13494}derek walks in on me|naked with his wife
{13494}{13542}actually in the throes
{13587}{13683}and he just turns around|and walks away.
{13683}{13753}but he sees me|so much as talking to you
{13781}{13813}and i'm on the ground bleeding.
{13851}{13889}interesting, don't you think?
{14091}{14117}what do you think you're doing?
{14117}{14141}you need stitches.
{14141}{14189}i know. hold the mirror.
{14467}{14517}why is he suturing his own face?
{14517}{14539}to turn me on.
{14558}{14585}because he's mark sloan.
{14585}{14652}he's like the go-to plastic surgeon|on the east coast.
{14652}{14697}that's the guy|addison was sleeping with?
{14697}{14721}well, you can't really|blame her, can you?
{14721}{14757}no, not really.
{14772}{14788}yes, you can.
{14812}{14870}mcsexy wants an x-ray|to check for fractures,
{14870}{14923}and i think it's a bad idea if i take him.
{14923}{14947}why? why?
{14947}{15016}i'm on it. why is it a bad idea?
{15016}{15047}mcsexy?
{15052}{15062}no?
{15098}{15129}mm. mcyummy.
{15129}{15177}-no|-no.
{15177}{15222}mcsteamy.
{15222}{15266}ah, there it is.|yep.
{15306}{15349}oh, excuse me,
{15349}{15417}i'm just chokin' back some mcvomit.
{15445}{15465}ooh.
{15469}{15498}i saw her first.
{15532}{15560}the night she met shepherd,
{15560}{15594}i had her ear.
{15596}{15637}we talked,
{15637}{15697}and i can't even remember what i said.
{15697}{15747}you know when you haven't|had sex for awhile,
{15747}{15798}you sort of forget how good it is
{15798}{15841}and don't really need it much?
{15860}{15896}yeah, that doesn't happen to guys.
{15896}{15932}it's like a beas...
{15932}{15949}a beast that was asleep
{15949}{16011}for a long,long time.
{16011}{16059}and now the beast is wide awake
{16059}{16088}and wants to be fed,
{16088}{16133}and the food that alex gave it was...
{16133}{16179}it was
{16179}{16208}good food, george.
{16208}{16244}something needs to be done|about your taste.
{16244}{16280}ah! you're just jealous
{16280}{16332}because you're beast is still asleep.
{16332}{16366}eh, my beast isn't asleep.
{16385}{16416}my beast never sleeps.
{16567}{16587}mr. eaton.
{16627}{16649}do you need a hand with that?
{16649}{16692}um, if you could set up the tripod,
{16692}{16740}that would be very helpful.
{16745}{16762}are you...
{16774}{16800}what are you doing?
{16824}{16855}i'm dying, dear.
{16886}{16903}one in four...
{16920}{17016}i, uh, i've never done well|with odds like that.

{17071}{17102}i just never have been.
{17116}{17150}the camera's for posterity,
{17188}{17208}for saying good-bye.

{17879}{17956}i loved you with my whole heart...
{17956}{18025}and i never would've|stopped loving you
{18025}{18073}if you hadn't been the vile whore
{18073}{18116}to ever walk the planet earth.
{18116}{18155}you deserve that...
{18155}{18188}that drunken imbecile
{18188}{18265}that you slept with and then married.
{18265}{18308}and when, at the reunion,

{18485}{18533}i am so deeply happy
{18533}{18553}that i'll never have to see

{33753}{33780}you know, i know dr. sloan

{34379}{34398}a second surgery
{34398}{34446}and a second round of anesthesia.
{34446}{34501}it's much safer just to|do it all at once.

{34537}{34561}on keeping you alive.
{34561}{34612}mom, i-i almost died

{36894}{36913}if you'd had kids?
{36971}{36985}do i think
