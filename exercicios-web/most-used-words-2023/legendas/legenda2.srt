1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,600
Come on,come on,come on,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,400
Come on,come on,come on,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,500
all right,good.That's good.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,400
You're doing good,dr. Burke.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,300
Okay,I need you to touch eachinger of your right hand to your thumb.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,900
One... two...

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,700
you're doing great.Keep going.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,100
Three. Good. One more.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,300
that's good.That'S...

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600
- dr. Hahn--
- wait for it.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,100
- dr. Hahn.
- Just wait!

12
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,000
I cut the lvad wire.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,400
Actually...

14
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,000
- I cut the lvad wire.
- no,I did it.

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm the one who cut the wire.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,900
Fine.I cut the lvad wire.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,400
I didn't do anything.

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm totally innocent.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,800
- alex.
- That's not the point.
- We made an agreement.

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,100
- I didn't even--
- I wasn't here.

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,000
- I told you guys this was a bad idea.
- People!

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,600
I know who did this,

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,300
so you might as well come clean.

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,500
I know.

25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,800
with all due respect,sir,

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,500
if you knew,

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,700
you wouldn't be asking us.

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,800
- I did what I--
- you have your suspicions,

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,400
but you don't actually know.

30
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,000
Not for sure.

31
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,400
And you can't do anything to any of us without proof,sir.

32
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,400
Well,one of you compromised a patient's life.

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,700
One of you stole an organ.

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,500
One of you jeopardized the integrity of this hospital

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,700
and of U.N.O.S.

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,500
Now you tell me,

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
and you tell me right now!

38
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,200
All right,fine.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,100
No surgeries.

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,900
Sir?

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,700
No one scrubs in,

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,500
no one so much as goes near the O.R. Floor.

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,100
Until someone confesses,

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
the five of you will share a single patient--

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,800
camille travis.

46
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,800
Whatever she wants,

47
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,300
the five of you will provide it.

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,000
Now get the hell out of my sight.

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
I will go back and tell him.

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,200
I will tell him it was me.

51
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,900
And get kicked out of therogram?

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
You will keep your mouth shut.

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,500
We all will keep our mouths shut.

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,500
This is crap.

55
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,500
I'm turning her in.

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,500
- Alex.
- What?

57
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,500
You were the one who said we had to stand by izzie.

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,300
I am sorry,

59
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,500
- and I really do appreciate what you did for denny.
- Oh,shut up.

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,900
Look,the only reason i lied to burke is

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,900
'cause I wanted in on that transplant surgery.

62
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't care about denny,

63
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,300
- and I hope you get thrown out on your ass.
- hey,

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,000
we stick together.

65
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,800
You know,we all did this.

66
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,600
Nobody's a victim.

67
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,500
We--we stick together.

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,900
Damn it.

69
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,600
Thank you.

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,500
- You're welcome.
- we can handle this.

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,900
Camille travis is a kid with cancer.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
So we get her whatever she wants for a couple of days.

73
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
How hard can that be?

74
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,200
Harder than you might think.

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,200
This claire and natalie--

76
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,200
camille travis' friends.

77
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,700
Her very best friends in the whole wide world.

78
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,500
Girls,who exactly is camille travis?

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
Like,the chiefo f surgery's niece.

80
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,300
And,girls,

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,100
what does the chief of surgery's niece want,exactly?

82
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,300
Like,a prom.

83
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,900
No. Like,

84
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,200
the best prom ever.

85
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,500
We need a theme.

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,000
a theme.

87
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,500
Ooh! Ooh!

88
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Can we have sparkly lights?

89
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,400
'Cause sparkly lights are amazing!

90
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,200
I didn't like teenage girls when I was a teenage girl.

91
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
I wore a lot of black.

92
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,500
- Ohh.
- Mm.

93
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,500
Had the whole "angry,

94
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,100
pink hair thing" going on.

95
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,800
Wouldn't have been caught dead at a prom.

96
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
My mother made me go.

97
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
My date barfed on my dress

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,600
and then tried to feel me up.

99
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,800
You look...

100
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,900
god,you look amazing.

101
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,700
They always tell you that transplant patients rebound fast,

102
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,300
but,you know,

103
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,500
to see it in person...

104
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,000
I have warm hands.

105
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,800
I've never had warm hands because of my circulation.

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,000
Feel.

107
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,300
Warm hands.

108
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
And check it out--

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
I have a regular heartbeat.

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,200
yes,you do.

111
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,000
I should,um--

112
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,900
I gotta go.

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,600
I would stay,

114
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,500
but if bailey catches me here,she'D...

115
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,000
and,uh,you know,

116
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,500
the chief has us doing this prom thing.

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,200
It's so...

118
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,500
you look...

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,300
whoo-hoo,denny.

120
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,100
okay,I'm gonna go.

121
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
- What?
- Huh?

122
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,400
You like your men sick and feeble?

123
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
You don't dig healthy guys?

124
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,000
I...

125
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,700
I dig you.

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Then why are you all swirly and twitchy?

127
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,000
No,I'm not.

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
It's 'cause I asked you to marry me.

129
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,300
So you remember that?

130
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,500
It's not the kind of thing i'd forget.

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,500
yeah.

132
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,100
Look,denny,um,

133
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
I'm giving you an out.

134
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,100
Excuse me?

135
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm giving you an out. I mean,

136
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,600
you thought you were dying,

137
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,400
and I was saving your life.

138
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,000
And,you know,

139
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,300
everything was so...

140
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
we can't get married.

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,300
I mean,that would be crazy,insane.

142
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,600
We should date and have sex,

143
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,700
plenty of sex.

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,700
You know,when your heart gets better,

145
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,500
and you' out of the hospit--

146
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,900
all the sex you can handle.

147
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,700
But marriage is,M...

148
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
marriage,I mean--

149
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,500
It's my turn now.

150
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,400
- But I need to--
- no,no,no. 

151
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
We're taking turns.

152
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,300
I've decided.

153
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,000
It's polite,

154
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,300
and it keeps me from yelling.

155
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
When it's your turn again,

156
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
you can talk.

157
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,300
for five years,

158
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,700
I've had to live by the choices of my doctors.

159
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,600
The guys that cut me open decided my life.

160
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,900
There wasn't one choice that was mine.

161
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,000
And now...

162
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,900
I have this heart that beats and works.

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
I get to be like everybody else.

164
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,500
I get to make my own decisions,

165
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,100
have my own life,

166
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,000
do whatever the damn hell i choose.

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,300
Now here's the good part,

168
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,900
so you listen close.

169
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,300
What I choose...

170
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,900
is you.

171
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
You're who I want to wake up with

172
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,100
and go to bed with

173
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,300
and do everything in between with.

174
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,600
I get a choice now.

175
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,100
I get to choose.

176
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,300
I choose you,izzie stevens.

177
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,200
it's your turn again.

178
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,500
They're not talking.

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,300
Wagons have been circled.

180
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Somebody's gotta take responsibility.

181
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,100
I-I can tell you what I think happened,

182
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,600
what I assume happened,

183
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,200
but they're the only ones tt know it.

184
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,700
I want to meet with each of them separately.

185
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
I will break them.

186
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,300
All right,then.

187
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,200
You have your dress for the prom?

188
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,700
Excuse me?

189
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
I'm going to the prom.

190
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,000
If I have to go,

191
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,700
everybody has to go.

192
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,900
Wha--I'm a grown woman.

193
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,100
Everybody goes to the prom!

194
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,400
Everybody!

195
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,100
Central high--

196
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,800
two years ago,

197
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
they went wi all black.

198
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,500
and they had,like,purple lights--

199
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,300
oh,yeah,I remember that.

200
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,600
Everybody looked like ghouls.

201
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,900
Fine. We could go with all white.

202
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,300
are you having a seizure?

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,100
Will that get me out of here?

204
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,200
Fine.

205
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's go with seizure.

206
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,700
For the love of god,

207
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
you people need to get a life!

208
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,400
The chief's niece.

209
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,300
It's okay. 

210
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
The hot ones e always mean.

211
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,100
It's like a rule or something.

212
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,700
Don't you dare try to judge us.

213
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,700
We're trying to make our friend,

214
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,500
who just happens to be dying of cancer,happy.

215
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
The color does matter.

216
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Maybe not to you,

217
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
but it does matter.

218
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,200
Not to bother you,but...

219
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,000
what?

220
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,900
One of you better spit out the problem right now.

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,100
The problem is the colors and--

222
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,000
and the balloons

223
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,200
and the "under the sea."

224
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,200
"No,it's 'titanic.'"

225
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,800
"Hey,let's go with 'tears in heaven.'"

226
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,600
"No,that's too morbid.

227
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,500
It should be pink."

228
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,100
"It should be red."

229
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,300
It should be a freakin' rainbow.

230
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,000
What he's saying is that

231
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
we're very,very hopeful that you speak teenage girl.

232
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,300
Silver and white--

233
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,600
it's mystical and magical without being over the top.

234
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,800
Ever see fashion week in new york?

235
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,800
Lots of silver and white runways and backdrops.

236
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,300
That's because no matter what color the clothes are,they pop.

237
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
- They pop?
- They pop.

238
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,400
O'malley and karev,

239
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,300
get 500 balloons in silver and white

240
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,100
and a hundred in black.

241
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
Shiny black,not the matte.

242
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,000
Yang,stick with camille.

243
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,900
Keep her happy,

244
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,700
keep her spirits up.

245
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
Grey,get with patricia,

246
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,300
make sure we can rope off the second floor nurses' station

247
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,100
and the waiting area.

248
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,800
Got it?

249
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,100
Oh,no,no,no. 

250
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,400
You don't get to look at me like tt.

251
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,200
No,you compromised my medical license.

252
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,000
You nearly killed a patient,

253
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,700
lied to the chief of surgery and made me,

254
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,900
your resident,look bad.

255
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,800
Now we're gonna do this prom,

256
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,000
and we're doin' it right. Move.

257
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,500
- Can you...
- yeah.

258
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,300
Hey.

259
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,200
You never called.

260
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,000
What?

261
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,200
Last night. 

262
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,900
We had plans,and you went off with izzie,

263
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,600
- and you never called.
- Yeah.

264
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,500
- You said you would.
- A lot of stuff went down last night.

265
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,300
What exactly happened?

266
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
I can't talk about it.

267
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,300
Oh,come on. 

268
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
I'm not gonna tell,george. 

269
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,100
It's me.

270
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,800
look,it's vegas.

271
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,600
What happened in that room stays in that room.

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,500
Okay.

273
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,300
- Yeah,I get it.
- Hey.

274
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
do you want to go to prom with me?

275
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,700
No,george! No.

276
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
I don't want to go prom with you.

277
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,300
What was that about?

278
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
She said she loved me.

279
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,500
Oh.

280
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,700
Oh! Hey.

281
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,000
I've been calling your cell all night.

282
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,600
Um...

283
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,900
oh,well,it's,uh...

284
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,200
it's a long story,

285
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,900
which essentially ends with me inviting you to a prom.

286
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,300
An actual prom?

287
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
- A corsages and tuxedoes--
- yeah,I know,

288
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,100
it's stupid,but...

289
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,500
no,I'm in. 

290
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,200
I loved prom.

291
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,500
I mean,I-I don't want to brag or anything,

292
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,900
but I was crowned king.

293
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,700
Really? 

294
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
You were that kid in high school?

295
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,400
- What is wrong with being that kid?
- Nothing. 

296
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,000
It's very cute,actually.

297
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,400
- Hello.
- hi.

298
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,300
What are you doin' here?

299
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
doc had some seizures last night.

300
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,700
Pretty serious.

301
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,400
The--the cancer has spread to his brain.

302
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm sorry.

303
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

304
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,000
How's preston?

305
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,200
He's recovering nicely.

306
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,900
Addison...

307
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't want to talk about it.

308
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,800
All right.

309
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
I mean,we've come so far--

310
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,100
- you forgave me for mark...
- mm-hmm.

311
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,000
And we're trying.

312
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
- We are. 
- We're trying.

313
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,000
- We are trying.
- We're trying.

314
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,600
And--and I was jealous when there was no need to be.

315
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,700
Right?

316
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,300
Addison...

317
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,400
what?

318
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,600
Will you go to the prom with me?

319
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,300
I went to college on a wrestling scholarship.

320
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,700
I played baseball,

321
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,600
some basketball,

322
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,700
but,you know,we'll go with football.

323
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,500
What the hell does football have to do with who cut the lvad wires?

324
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,300
Let's say you were drafted to a team that wasn't your first pick.

325
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,400
You know,you don't--you don't like the players,

326
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,200
you hate the way they play the game,

327
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,800
you even think the quarterback is full of crap.

328
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,200
The quarterback's a pain in the ass

329
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,800
that you don't owe a damn thing to.

330
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
But... it's your team.

331
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,700
You don't quit,

332
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,300
you don't talk to the press,

333
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,100
you don'T...

334
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,500
bitch to the coach.

335
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,100
You just...

336
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
you just go out there every sunday,

337
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,200
and you make the blocks,

338
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,200
and you take the hits,

339
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,900
and you--you play to win.

340
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,900
You show up,and you suit up,

341
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,700
and you play,

342
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,400
because it's your freakin' team.

343
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,000
I know your type.

344
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,000
you're a surgical junkie.

345
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,100
Yes,sir.

346
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,300
I'm just saying,

347
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,800
it's not gonna be easy for you to be away from the O.R. That long.

348
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,700
No,sir.

349
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,300
And if youant to get back to the O.R.,

350
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,900
You're gonna tell me what i need to know,aren't you?

351
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,800
You're right.

352
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,800
It's not easy for me to be away from the O.R.

353
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,500
It's not easy for me to sit in front of you,

354
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,300
or any other authority figure for that matter,

355
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,100
and not be able to give you the exact answer you want to hear.

356
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,800
I'm the one with the answers.

357
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,600
I've always been the one with the answers.

358
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,100
But right now,sir,

359
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,500
I don't have any.

360
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,400
Dr. Yang--

361
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,700
how do you keep your edge,sir?

362
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,400
Because I watch you,

363
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,900
and you've been doing this a long time,

364
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
and--and you're clean.

365
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,200
You're focused,

366
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,400
you are the job,

367
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,400
nothing gets to you.

368
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,700
And the thing is,sir,

369
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,200
is I was like that until I got here,

370
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
until I actually started doing this job.

371
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,900
And now everything is...

372
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,200
- is fuzzy or--
- that's beside the point.

373
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,800
No,see,sir?

374
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,800
This is the point.

375
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,600
Because I can't tell you what happened in that room.

376
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,200
I can't tell you,

377
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,400
and before,

378
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,200
I could have--

379
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,900
no guilt,no loyalties,

380
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,900
no problem.

381
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,300
Before--

382
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,900
before,I wouldn't have even been in that room.

383
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
I wouldn't have gotten involved,

384
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
I would have never frozen in surgery,

385
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,700
and I would've told him what I thought he should do.

386
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
I had an edge,sir.

387
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,100
I had an edge,

388
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
and I've lost it.

389
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
And I need it.

390
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,600
I need it back.

391
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,100
So...

392
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,700
if you could just tell me how you keep yours

393
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,100
and how not to be affected...

394
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,000
I know I could be a great surgeon.

395
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
So if you could just give me the answers,

396
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,000
I would really appreciate it.

397
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,500
you're excused,dr. Yang.

398
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,900
- But--
- you're excused.

399
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,400
I'll tell you.

400
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,000
- I'll tell you who cut the lvad wire,sir...
- no,you won'T.

401
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,300
- If you could just please--
- I don't want to know,

402
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,700
not from you.

403
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah,I have the answers,

404
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,400
but I can't tell 'em to you.

405
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm not gonna be responsible for you becoming less human.

406
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm a pretty girl.

407
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,600
What?

408
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,100
I'm not being arrogant,

409
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,800
it's just...

410
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,300
it's just kind of a fact.

411
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,700
For a long time,I made a career from my looks,

412
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,500
so I get it--

413
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm a pretty girl.

414
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,100
And not in a "from "a certain angle" way,

415
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,100
in an obvious way.

416
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,000
It's the blonde thing and the big boobs thing.

417
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
Big boobs are key to obvious pretty,

418
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,400
if you know what I'm saying.

419
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,200
Dr. Stevens--

420
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,500
that's how men see me.

421
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,300
I'm not a smart girl or an interesting girl,

422
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm a pretty girl.

423
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
The blonde and the boobs,

424
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,900
it confuses guys into thinking that I'm someone else.

425
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,800
And I'm used to it.

426
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,500
I'm used to them walking away when they realize...

427
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,600
but then denny goes and asks me to marry him.

428
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,100
Is that why you cut the wires?

429
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,400
He doesn't make me feel like I'm a pretty girl.

430
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,300
he makes me feel like...

431
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,200
like me.

432
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,300
I think he might know me.

433
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,300
And so if I did cut the lvad wire,

434
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,500
and I'm not saying that I did,

435
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,100
but if I did...

436
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,200
then,no,

437
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,200
I don't feel guilty.

438
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,500
And I know that I should,

439
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,800
and I would if it were anybody else.

440
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,100
but I can't feel anything but happy.

441
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,200
aren't you gonna...

442
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,000
say anything or...

443
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm not gonna break.

444
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
I'm starting to get a little freaked out,

445
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,600
but I'm not gonna break.

446
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,700
it's not because I don't care,

447
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,400
because I do care what you think about me,

448
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,000
I do...

449
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,200
care.

450
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,700
I just can't tell you what you want to hear...

451
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,500
which seems to be a theme in my life right now.

452
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,000
Just 'cause you can't say something doesn't mean you don't want to.

453
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,500
You can want to very much.

454
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,600
You can be with a person

455
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,100
and be happy with them

456
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,800
and not love them,

457
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,800
or you can love someone

458
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
and not want to be with them.

459
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,000
You don't need to.

460
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,200
Love someone to want them.

461
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,800
Oh,it's frustrating.

462
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,300
You know,when your brain tells you what you want

463
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,900
and what you actually want don't match up,

464
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
it's exhausting.

465
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,800
And...

466
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,600
well,it's complicated.

467
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,800
But that's life.

468
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,800
And life...

469
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
sucks.

470
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,200
I've known you for a long time.

471
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,600
I know your mother and father.

472
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
And I know beyond a shadow of a doubt

473
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,800
that you did not cut those lvad wires.

474
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,500
Meredith...

475
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,500
I need you tell me who did it.

476
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
I've been going over this

477
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,000
and over this in my mind,

478
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,500
trying to piece this together.

479
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,000
It was you.

480
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
You're the reason my parents broke up.

481
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,700
And it wasn't just an affair.

482
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,700
She really loved you.

483
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,800
It wasn't just this cheap thing

484
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
where she didn't tell you

485
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
she was married.

486
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,800
It wasn't all a lie.

487
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,800
She left her husband for you.

488
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,700
But you stayed with your wife

489
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
because it was the right thing to do.

490
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,000
Maybe safe,

491
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,500
but she was the right person for you to be with.

492
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,800
And let's face it,my mother?

493
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,600
Nothing wrong with being safe,

494
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,400
being with the good guy

495
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,800
because he's good.

496
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,600
And we are talking about forever here.

497
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,100
You've never regretted your decision.

498
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,100
You've never looked back.

499
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,100
right?

500
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,700
finn???????,doc

501
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,900
Good for finn.

502
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,100
Can we just do this one thing together without arguing?

503
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,100
Fine.

504
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,500
I think we may have to put him to sleep.

505
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Whatever you want to do.

506
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,000
What if there's a chance he can get better?

507
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,000
He's not gonna get better.

508
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,900
You know that.

509
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,300
Well,finn thinks we should do it today,then.

510
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,500
denny.

511
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,300
What did I tell you?

512
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,900
Visiting hours aren't for another hour.

513
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,200
You are no longer his doctor.

514
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,900
You want to see denny,

515
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,300
you come back when the visitors come.

516
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,500
I would,but I can't wait.

517
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
Ixnay on the insubordination-ay

518
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,500
but it's my turn.

519
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,500
If the chief finds out you were even on this floor--

520
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,100
hold on. 

521
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,800
It's her turn.

522
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes.

523
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
My answer is yes.

524
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,600
Oh,now,see?

525
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,500
You're gonna make my heart stop beating,

526
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,400
and it's brand-new.

527
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,700
I will call security on you.

528
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,000
Okay.I will come back during visiting hours.

529
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,900
And it's prom,

530
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,300
so I'll show you my dress.

531
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,200
Okay.

532
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,500
I'm going.

533
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,200
Izzie...

534
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,000
you did good.

535
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,700
I tricked her into marrying me.

536
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
How smart am I?

537
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,200
We're throwing a prom.

538
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,000
The chief's making us throw a prom.

539
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,000
O'malley mentioned.

540
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,500
George came to see you?

541
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
He's my friend.

542
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,300
Oh.

543
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
I won't bear a grudge.

544
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,300
What did you...

545
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,500
I have to take care of me.

546
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,900
I don't expect you to take care of me,

547
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,600
but I have to take care of me.

548
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,500
And if this...

549
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,700
if you can't stay here for this...

550
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,100
I won't bear a grudge.

551
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,900
Are you gonna tell shepherd about...

552
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,900
not yet.

553
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm,uh...

554
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,800
not yet.

555
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,200
Okay,there's a couple of forms you need to sign.

556
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,200
I-I only need one signature.

557
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,200
Well,you--

558
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,800
it's fine.

559
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,400
Here,I'll--ll sign.

560
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,600
So how do we do this?

561
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,600
Well,I'll give doc an injection of terole to make him sleepy,

562
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,600
and then I'll give him an I.V.

563
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,000
Injection of phenobarbital.

564
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,000
And that'll stop his heart.

565
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,800
Yes.

566
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,300
And what do we do after,

567
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,600
with his body?

568
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,200
We can...

569
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,400
we have the means to dispose of it for you.

570
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,600
That's fine. Go ahead.

571
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,600
We can't throw him away like he's garbage.

572
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,600
we would never--

573
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,100
he's our dog,derek.

574
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,100
There's that,uh,

575
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,300
clearing by the trailer.

576
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,500
Overlookinthe water.

577
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,400
We can,uh,

578
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,200
bury him there.

579
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,500
That sounds nice.

580
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,500
- You ready?
- Yeah.

581
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
I'm so sorry,doc.

582
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,800
I'm sorry,too.

583
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,200
that's the hospital.

584
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,400
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

585
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,600
I'll begin.

586
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,800
Shh.

587
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,600
It's okay.

588
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,300
it's okay.

589
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,200
It's okay.

590
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,600
It's okay.

591
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,100
he's gone.

592
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,200
meredith--

593
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,800
no,I have to go home and change.

594
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,300
I'll see you later,okay?

595
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,000
Meredith...

596
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm sorry... for your loss.

597
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,900
Yeah.

598
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,900
You know,the thing is,

599
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,600
he wasn't really my dog for that long.

600
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,700
He was more derek's dog.

601
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,600
Meredith...

602
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,100
he was a good dog.

603
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,900
He was.

604
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,400
oh,I'm too tired for this.

605
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,300
Where's your husband,dr. Bailey?

606
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,100
Uh,at home with the baby.

607
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,800
Thought you'd at least get to get outta this.

608
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,500
Why?

609
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,500
Well,with burke upstairs...

610
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,000
what happened to him,

611
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,600
I'm sure the chief would've let you out

612
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,700
yeah.

613
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,100
- hey.
- Hey.

614
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,300
Have you seen meredith?

615
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,800
I don't think she's here yet.

616
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,600
this whole thing is bringing back very traumatic memories of being a band geek with braces 

617
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,200
and a lisp

618
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,800
and spending the whole evening with skippy gold talking about "star wars."

619
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,700
so,you want to,um,dance?

620
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,100
Love to.

621
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,400
Can I cut in?

622
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,100
What did you say to my boyfriend to make him that scared of you?

623
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm a frightening man,cammie.

624
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,900
no,you're not.

625
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,700
Where brian's concerned,

626
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,300
yes,I am.

627
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,700
Be kind to him.

628
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,900
He loves me.

629
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,900
I've been loved.

630
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,000
And that's something everyone should have once in their life.

631
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,300
I've been loved.

632
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,800
Thank you for the prom,uncle richard.

633
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,800
You're welcome.

634
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,400
Hey,I was looking for--

635
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,800
where are you going?

636
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,200
I'm wearing a dress,

637
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,100
I have on heels,

638
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,800
I shaved my legs--

639
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,700
I'm going to the prom.

640
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,100
You said that you didn't want to go.

641
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,500
No,I said I didn't want to go with you.

642
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,500
Callie!

643
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,900
I said,"I love you."

644
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,700
I said it.

645
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,500
I said it out loud to your face,

646
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,000
and ever since,you--

647
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,700
I have never said that to a guy before,never.

648
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,600
And now I am just this idiot who says I love you

649
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,600
and then gets avoided.

650
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
No,I'm not avoiding you.

651
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,200
I promise.

652
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,900
You gonna say it back?

653
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,000
No.

654
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,600
I'm humiliated.

655
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,900
No,george,let me go.

656
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,300
George,leme go.

657
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,800
Let me go.

658
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Stop fighting me.

659
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,000
If I say it back right now,

660
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,800
you know I'm just sayin' it

661
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,900
because you said it to me.

662
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,700
When I--

663
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,500
when I say I love you,

664
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
I want to mean it because...

665
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,400
you--you just have to give me some time to mean it.

666
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,100
I hate that I'm so into you.

667
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,000
You're a lot hotter than my last prom date.

668
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,300
Is that a compliment?

669
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,200
Maybe.

670
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,200
It feels like a compliment.

671
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,600
Then it is.

672
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,100
Well,keep it up.

673
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,300
You might get lucky.

674
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,100
Well,now how lucky are we talking?

675
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,400
Are we talking kinda lucky,

676
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,200
or are we talking really seriously lucky?

677
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,800
You have been a very patient man,

678
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,700
and I appreciate it.

679
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,700
What?

680
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,200
liz,uh--

681
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
liz was my wife--

682
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,000
and when she died...

683
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
y-you get this thing,you know,

684
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
where--where you stop making plans.

685
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,600
Be-because you had plans,

686
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,400
but then there's a car crash

687
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,400
and your plans disappeared.

688
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,000
So you just...

689
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,500
I just try and get from sunup to sundown.

690
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,800
That's as far into the future as I can handle.

691
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,000
And I've been fine with that.

692
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,600
I have.

693
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,800
But right now,

694
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,700
looking at you...

695
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,000
damn,I-I have all kinds of plans.

696
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,500
Don't--don't freak out.

697
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,200
I'm not.

698
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,700
You're not?

699
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,800
No.

700
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
You have plans.

701
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,800
I have plans.

702
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,100
You all right?

703
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,600
Yeah,it's just,uh,

704
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,200
hot and... claustrophobic.

705
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,900
You know what? 

706
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,400
There's a patient i've gotta go check on.

707
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,500
I think I'm just gonna run and splash some cold water on my face.

708
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,100
I'll be right back,okay?

709
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,400
I'll be right back,okay?

710
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,600
- Okay.
- All right.

711
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,500
Meredith.

712
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,700
Leave me alone.

713
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,500
Meredith.

714
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,500
Just leave me alone.

715
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,800
I just wanted to make sure you were all rig.

716
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,200
No! I'm not all right. Okay?

717
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,500
Are you satisfied?

718
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,900
I'm not all right,

719
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,300
because you have a wife,

720
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,000
and you call me a whore,

721
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,300
and our dog died.

722
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,500
And now you're looking at me.

723
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,700
- Stop looking at me.
- I'm not looking at you.

724
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
I am not looking at you.

725
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,700
You are looking at me,

726
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,900
and you watch me.

727
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
And finn has plans.

728
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,200
And I like finn,

729
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,100
he's perfect for me,

730
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,700
and I'm really trying here to be happy.

731
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,100
And I can't breathe.

732
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,400
I can't breathe with you looking at me like that,

733
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,700
so just stop!

734
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,800
Do you think I want to look at you?

735
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,600
That I wouldn't rather be looking at my wife?

736
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,400
I'm married.

737
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,200
I have responsibilities.

738
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,500
She--she doesn't drive me crazy,

739
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,100
she doesn't make it impossible for me to feel normal,

740
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,100
she doesn't make me sick to my stomach

741
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,700
thinking about my veterinarian touching her with his hands!

742
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,500
Oh,man,I would give anything not to be looking at you.

743
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,100
Whoa. You look nice.

744
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Thank you. So do you.

745
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,700
Hot date?

746
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,500
Nah. This thing is cheesy.

747
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,000
I wouldn't waste a decent chick on this.

748
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,500
you headin' in?

749
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,200
Yeah,I'm just gonna see denny first.

750
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,500
Oh,okay.

751
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,900
what does this mean?

752
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,700
Uh,I had panties on.

753
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,900
Black. 

754
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,500
Do you see them?

755
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,300
Meredith,what does this mean?

756
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,600
Help me look for them.

757
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,700
- And fix your tie.
- Meredith...

758
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,100
what does this mean?

759
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,900
Oh,the nurse told me to come find you.

760
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You have to come now.It's izzie.

761
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,900
Wait,wait,wait.

762
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,600
Okay,go.

763
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,200
chief.

764
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,000
I did my internship here,

765
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,900
my residency,

766
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,200
came back here the minute my fellowship was done.

767
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,800
The day they told me i would be chief,

768
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,800
I was standing right there in that O.R.

769
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,600
Spent my whole career in this hospital.

770
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,500
My whole life.

771
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,900
Sir...

772
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,700
denny duquette died at 7:42 this evening.

773
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,800
Damn it.

774
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,200
What happened?

775
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,900
I didn't know what to do.

776
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,300
I-I didn't think you guys would want me to go to the chief--

777
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,300
where is she?

778
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,300
She's in there with him.

779
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,000
izzie.

780
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,900
I think it was a stroke.

781
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,200
He was prone to blood clots.

782
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,700
A clot could have formed on his sutures,

783
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,000
traveled to his brain.

784
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,200
It only takes a second.

785
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,100
Iz...

786
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,700
dr. Hahn did a beautiful job on the surgery.

787
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,600
But I don't know why i didn't think of blood clots.

788
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,500
He died all alone.

789
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,600
He was alone.

790
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,900
There was nothing you could've done.

791
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,200
I changed my dress three times.

792
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,700
I wanted to look nice.

793
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,100
I would've been here sooner...

794
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,500
but I couldn't figure out which dress to wear.

795
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,500
Izzie...

796
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
we shouldn't be in here.

797
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,700
iz,there are things that they need--

798
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,000
they need to move him.

799
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,500
Take him to the morgue.

800
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,600
You can't stay here.

801
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,600
I know you want to--

802
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,700
can you please,

803
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,600
please just get out?

804
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,600
I want to be alone with denny.

805
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,000
izzie,that's not denny.

806
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,000
Shut up.

807
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,400
iz...

808
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,000
that's not denny.

809
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,800
the minute his heart stopped beating,

810
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,000
he stopped being denny.

811
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,100
Now I know you love him,

812
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,500
but he also loved you.

813
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,400
And a guy that loves you like that,

814
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,400
he doesn't want you to do this to yourself.

815
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,000
Because it's not denny,

816
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,200
not anymore.

817
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,200
An hour ago,he was proposing.

818
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,300
And now...

819
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,100
and now he's going to the morgue.

820
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,800
Isn't that ridiculous?

821
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:57,100
Isn't at the most ridiculous piece of crap you've ever heard?

822
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,200
come on.

823
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm sorry.

824
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,500
These are ridic--hey.

825
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,300
- Hi.
- Derek,where have you been?

826
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,500
- Uh,I was with a patient.
- Shepherd.

827
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,100
Yes?

828
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,700
Have you seen bailey's interns--

829
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,900
grey,yang?

830
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,600
I'm looking for izzie stevens in particular.

831
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,100
No,I haven'T. No.

832
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,300
Chief.

833
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,200
It was me.

834
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,400
I cut his lvad wire.

835
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,900
I did it. No one helped me.

836
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,400
And now...

837
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,200
I thought i was a surgeon,but...

838
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,300
I can'T.

839
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
I thought I was a surgeon,

840
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,000
but I am not.

841
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,500
So I quit.

842
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,200
Izzie.

843
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,300
Well,I guess that...

844
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,000
- puts an end to the evening.
- Yeah.
